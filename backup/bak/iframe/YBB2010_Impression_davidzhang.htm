knowing what to expect, but I had high hopes for a trip that was entirely
designed to bring the world to a small, poor, rural village in the middle of Shandong Province in China. Getting on the bus was a daunting task―8 hours of sitting in a
seat. But it turned out to be much, much more fun than I did expect. When the Shanghai tour group came on the bus, I didn’t know most of them. Yet sitting alone for 8
straight hours seemed like a really boring prospect, so I began to play Mafia
with the rest of the people on board. In that manner, a few hours passed like a
few minutes, and before I knew it, we were turning on to a dusty road in the
middle of absolutely nowhere. With sand and dust everywhere, I jumped off the
bus into perhaps the hottest temperatures I have experienced in years. Turning
around and squinting in the sunlight, the afternoon air and the buildings
surrounding me seemed to meld together. One thing led to another, and pretty
soon, we were introduced to our dorms. An ominous row of darkened rooms, we had
to clean out the musty rooms that were dirtier than my garage. After scrubbing
and sweeping, driving away hordes of insects, waiting for a fix on a broken
faucet, and finally getting our room in decent condition, we went to dinner at
a restaurant not far from where the school is. Getting back sort of late, I
took a cold shower and went to sleep on a lovely wooden board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 1<sup>st</sup>―After a surprisingly comfortable
night considering the circumstances I slept under, I discovered we were eating
breakfast at the same restaurant as we ate dinner last night. The food was
decent, but I was really hoping for some good milk and cereal. I guess not all
dreams come true. On the way back to the school, we stopped at a convenience
store that looked pretty good. There people bought flashlights, washing bowls,
towels, clothes hangers, drinks, anything that one could want (well, maybe not
anything).Though I regret the decision now, I chose not to purchase anything at
that store. However, we made another stop on the return trip, at an ice cream
and popsicle stand by the side of the dusty road filled with puddles of mud.
Now, I do enjoy ice cream in America, but the popsicles in China tasted absolutely divine. Either that or I was really thirsty/hot. The rest of the
day was spent inside a hot and stuffy room on the third floor of the school,
learning about the master plans for the lessons we would teach tomorrow. After
a couple hours of fanning and reluctant listening, I finally grasped the
enormity of the task ahead of me when the presentations of the master lessons
of each class were over and felt totally unprepared for tomorrow. With that
thought, the rest of the day passed by quickly. I was surprised by how quickly
sleep washed over me that night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 2<sup>nd</sup>―The first day of teaching
started off a little differently than usual. Still getting accustomed to the
regimen, I woke up groggily and prepared myself for the day, then went to the
cafeteria for breakfast that consisted of eggs, carrots, and tasteless
flatbread. I did not know why, but I had first day jitters just thinking about
the prospect of an entire classroom staring at me while I was teaching. I
strolled into Classroom 5 right after breakfast and immediately tripped. Not
the best first impression. At least the class laughed. After introducing
ourselves (Me, Danting, Peter, Qian Peng, Wang Bing, and Xu Han Yue) began the
first class of the day, English. For English, Danting and I were the lead
teachers for the class. We decided to strictly adhere to the original lesson
plan for minimal hitches during the class, but soon, both expected and
unexpected problems occurred. Expectedly, the language barrier became an issue.
Only after a few sentences in Chinese, words appeared that became difficult to
translate. I burned with disappointment inwardly, but then the college students
stepped in. While Danting and I were busy with our recovery, the college
students filled in the time with a quick overview of the material we had
covered already. At that moment, I realized that cohesive teamwork was going to
be a cinch for us. Now the unexpected problem―the students were really smart.
They already knew the vocabulary and grammar we were trying to teach them. With
no apparent solution in mind, we decided to move on. However, this problem
became a recurring issue throughout the day. Whether it was music, computer, or
travel around the world, my students knew the material already. I was both
proud and disheartened, and finally experienced for myself the differences
between the education system in America and China. After lunch and a meeting on
the fourth floor for the entire school, it was time for project. Danting,
Peter, and I had no idea about what the project was but the college students
told us it was a project that they had been working on prior to this trip. I
watched with curiosity as Wang Bing led them in a game that translated to
Squirrel Hugging a Big Tree. At the end of the game, the students, huffing and
puffing, listened as the college students capped the game off with a quick
lesson on teamwork and cooperation, the way to win the game. I realized that
our college students’ project was on teamwork and capacity building just as it
was time for the last lesson of the day: P.E. The minute I told the kids that
we were to go outside on the field, 50 screaming children charged the door. As
the entire school streamed outwards, organization was hopeless and so we
allowed our students to do whichever activity they wanted. When it was finally
dismissal, I was deafened by the silence that greeted my ears. Wearily, I
trudged back to the lounge and was happy to find that I had free time. I spent
it playing a game called Signs with the other volunteers. After dinner, I sat
through a meeting in the hot stuffy science room on the third floor to cover
today’s events. My group was praised by Mrs. Teng on our teamwork. I found out
that every group encountered the same problem we did, that the students knew
the material already. It soon became a blur to me as I got drowsier and
drowsier. As soon as the meeting ended, I rushed out the door to go take a cold
shower that cleared up my senses. The long day ended as I fell asleep in the
stuffiness of the dorm room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 3<sup>rd</sup>―In comparison to yesterday,
today was a breeze. The main event during today’s class time was me getting to
know the students better. Yesterday, I felt myself distanced from them, but I
knew that I should probably socialize with at least some of them. One thing I
noticed about the students was that they were really shy and were not very
willing to introduce themselves to me. But there were exceptions. One boy in
particular, whose English name was Max, seemed to stir up trouble in the
classroom effortlessly. I will never forget his mischievous, cheeky complexion.
With inwardly slanted eyebrows, every time I saw him I felt as if he was going
to pull the hair of the girl in front of him, or throw a spitball at me. When I
went over to ask him to introduce himself, he muttered his name and, with a
cheeky smile, ducked away. I sighed and went to another row of students. In
this manner, I met many of the students―who were very interesting people. There
was Sasi, the level 8 Gu Zheng player. There was Austin, a gentle giant who was
an expert at Chinese Chess. There was Amelia, a tough girl who wanted to play
basketball with all the guys. And there was Joe, the boy with the loudest voice
I had ever heard who was very prone to fighting. I realized that I would have a
hard time planning the final performance if the students were shy even talking
to me. Pondering this question, the day passed effortlessly―too effortlessly.
It was after school had ended that I realized I had left my laptop and backpack
in the classroom, but now it was locked and too late. Sighing, I waited
anxiously for tomorrow and hope that my belongings are still there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 4<sup>th</sup>―The first thing I noticed when I
woke up was the pitter of raindrops falling on the roof. Immediately, I looked
up to see if the roof was leaking. GOOD thing it wasn’t. At any rate, I decided
not to wash my clothes then and wash it tonight. Blinking the sleep from my
eyes, I stepped outside and was really surprised to find it was 6:46 already.
After washing up and getting ready, I remembered that I had left my name tag in
the meeting room last night, lost my umbrella, and left my backpack and laptop
inside the classroom. Standing in the rain for a few minutes and feeling
flustered, I decided to sit on the problems. The rest of the time went by
quickly, and soon it was time to start class. I strolled in the classroom with
a nonchalant air, and was happy to find that my stuff was still there. Pretty
soon, most of the class arrived. I guessed that the empty seats were due to the
heavy rain, but I also saw some unfamiliar faces that I didn’t recognize. When
Bing arrived, we started off English. After a slight review of vocabulary that
the students knew very well, Bing taught them a poem I thought was really
romantic:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>“</span><span
lang=EN-US>The furthest distance in the world<br>
&nbsp;Is not between life and death,<br>
&nbsp;But when I am standing in front of you&nbsp;<br>
Yet you don’t know that I love you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>At that point, our skit was ready, but we decided to
save that for last and so we taught them a song (I’m a Little Teapot). Learning
the song was tricky, but it was finally time for the skit. Skitting the story
of Cinderella seemed pointless to me, but seeing the amusement on the faces and
hearing it in the laughter of the children gave me renewed motivation and
enthusiasm. In the skit, I was Cinderella and Danting was the prince.&nbsp;The
entire play was a comical reenactment and the students laughed throughout the
skit. Glad that this was such a success, I asked for volunteers to perform a
skit of their own. To my surprise, silence greeted me. The fifty laughing
students had suddenly turned solemn at the hint that they might perform. Though
in the end, I picked out a few students to do the skit, the heart had gone out
from it and I was again left speculating about the final performance. The day took
its toll on me and the heat became unbearable. That night, I went to sleep
without washing my clothes because I was too tired. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 5<sup>th</sup>―Remembering my promise to
myself, I finally faced the large pile of unwashed clothes that had subtly
built up under my nose. With some free time after lunch, I headed off to the
dorms and dutifully picked up the dirty laundry, then set a shirt in a washing
bowl. Filling it up with water, I added some laundry detergent and―I had no
idea what to do next. I had never washed my own clothes before. So after
minutes of random scrubbing, I hoped I had made it cleaner than it was before.
I hung it up on the clothesline outside, and rinsed and repeated. In this
manner I plowed through the pile until I had taken up about half the
clothesline. But at least I was finally done. With dripping hands, I watched
with satisfaction as my hand-washed clothes began drying. School today was
uneventful, but dinner today was special. We had the chance to make our own
food―we would wrap dumplings. I pondered whether or not to go to the cafeteria
for making the dumplings. On the one hand, I could get to experience firsthand
the joys of working in a kitchen. On the other hand, the kitchen was sweltering
and I would be sweating buckets. I chose the former. At any rate, when I
arrived, the two tables had already filled up with eager volunteers watching
two women, one at each table, skillfully knead the dough into many small
spheres, and then flatten them with the rolling pin into a circular shape. As I
edged into one of the tables, the woman grabbed the spoon and put a dollop of
the mixture of pork and vegetables into the center of the dumpling skin, then
deftly folded up the dumpling and pinched the skin so that it remained shut.
She made it look so easy, I knew I had to try to make one. As we gathered
around the table, she made sure that everyone had thoroughly washed their
hands. Then, we each picked up a circular piece of dumpling skin and prepared
to make our own dinner. When it was my turn to put the pork-vegetable mixture
into the dumpling skin, I spooned up too much and my folding attempt was
unsuccessful. Sighing, I produced a misshapen monstrosity that had the mixture
leaking out of the sides. The next one I tried was better, but I had scooped up
too little this time. Not wanting to create another weird dumpling, I decided
to make it into something better―a mini steamed bun. I pinched the sides upward
and twisted the top of it until I had made the perfect shape, then placed my
masterpiece onto the communal tray. And then I set about my work methodically,
taking great care when scooping up the mixture into the dumpling. 20 minutes
later, there was no more of the pork and vegetable mixture and we called it
quits. I gazed upon the tray―a sampling of the most unique shapes of dumpling
one could ever see. I watched proudly as the women carried the tray into the
kitchen. As cooking the massive batch of dumplings would take time, I headed
off to the A/C room. When dinner time came along, I rushed into the cafeteria
to see the fruits of our labor. The women came out with big, steaming bowls of
dumplings and everyone dug in. Combined with the sauce that was put out, it was
the most delicious meal I had ever had in Shandong. With a full stomach of
dumplings, I was contented for the rest of the day and went to sleep happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 6<sup>th</sup> ―On this last day before
Saturday and Sunday, I was really excited for the weekend. We're going to the Temple of Confucius, the Tomb of Confucius, the Mansion of Confucius, and Tai Shan (Prosperous Mountain). But before that, 1 more day of teaching to go. I noticed that the
students seemed extra restless today, but I could not blame them. As school
began to start, I realized that some volunteers had not come to school today. I
wondered why, but not for long. Assuming my responsibilities, I began to teach
English. After English class was over, I realized something was wrong when Mrs.
Teng approached me. She told me that due to the dumplings we had consumed many
volunteers had become sick. All the high school volunteers of class 8―Colby,
Michael, and Angela―had fallen ill, so she asked me to go and assist the
college students in that class. Later, David Chen joined me to help out in
classroom 8. After lunch, we went back to our respective classrooms and taught
the rest of the day. When school ended, I headed across the street with a few
other volunteers to the store over there. While most of the products for sale
seemed sketchy and were dusty, I noticed a set of nunchucks behind the counter
in the glass case and inquired the price. When I discovered it was only </span><span
lang=EN-US>&yen;7 RMB, I immediately wanted to purchase it. Walking out of the
store, I was one set of nunchucks richer. </span><span lang=EN-US>As dinner
reverted back to the regular cuisine (flatbread, a mild soup, vegetables, and
another constantly changing side dish) perhaps due to the food issues, I began
to feel almost bored with the monotonous routing that was settling in. It was a
good thing today is Friday. In preparation for the vacation, I took my backpack
and dumped out its useless contents, then packed a set of clothes and a pair of
sneakers. I couldn’t wait for the hot showers, flushable toilets, and soft beds
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, and 11<sup>th</sup>―The
weekend vacation, in my opinion, was far from relaxing. But I felt that it was
still a welcome break from the now everyday task of teaching. As an added
bonus, the motel seemed luxurious with its beds, showers and toilets. But now
that it's over, I plunge headlong into the second week of YBB. Despite having
called the dumplings the most delicious meal in Shandong, I now renounce my
statement and state that the Shandong Jian Bing, or more colloquially the
burritos among the volunteers, are the best thing I have eaten here. I never
could imagine that bean sprouts, carrots, and other vegetables, along with a
sausage, sweet sauce, and spicy powder all wrapped up in a tough, stringy
flatbread could taste so good. I had discovered this small nugget of food
treasure on a store across the street. However, I never knew the hidden
potential risks. Only hours later, I discovered that many people had become
sick from eating these delicious, but actually dirty, burritos. The parent
chaperones and Mrs. Teng were very displeased when they discovered we had
purchased food from outside of the school. Then, to my surprise, the teachers
who owned the popsicle store announced that they were going to start a burrito
stand. And so whenever I would be sick of eating in the cafeteria, it was the
burrito stand to my rescue. These three days passed quickly, with the teaching
inside the classroom going very smoothly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>August 12<sup>th</sup>―As the final performance nears,
I'm tense and worried that our class is not prepared. To my relief, I'm glad
that Bing says he has it under control. He's also one of the main supervisors
for the entire final performance, so I asked him if he needed any help managing
our class's final performance, but he declined. We decided to run through our
lessons very quickly that day―and so the kids would have greater time for
preparations on the performances. After we had finished teaching the
abbreviated lessons, our team of teachers plunged into the first part of our
performance―recorders. As 50, shrieking, annoying sounds rose into the air, I
sighed and realized we had a lot of work to do. An hour later, asides my ears
being close to deafened, our class was finally in satisfactory condition for
the recorders. Next, we had planned a lineup of popular Chinese songs for the
class to sing including</span><span style='font-family:宋体;color:#333333;
letter-spacing:-.4pt'>奔</span><span style='font-family:宋体;color:#333333;
letter-spacing:-.4pt'>跑</span><span lang=EN-US> by Yu Quan and Huang Zhang and </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>我相信</span><span lang=EN-US>by Yang Pei An as well as an
American song, We’re All in This Together from High School Musical. While we
spent a solid amount of time on the Chinese songs, the students easily
memorized the lyrics because the regularly listened to those songs anyway. The
truly difficult part was the song from High School Musical. Even thought the
students were regularly pretty good at English, when put into the form of a
melody the kids seemed to mumble and stumble through the song, as if groping in
the dark for the right tune. I do admit, however, the song was a hard one to
learn. Splitting into 5 groups, I supervised group 4, the group with the
downright hardest part of the song. After an hour of unenthusiastic monotone
chanting, I finally put a little melody in their words. Afterwards, Danting
came to help group 4 and I was relieved at the extra help. The students’ energy
was not endless though, and we had to stop and take a break from the practice.
After the break, we resumed the practice until it cut into the project time.
Despite the project presentations being over, the project teaching time was
still there. Our project time cut into our P.E. time, but we decided that was
okay. As we finally dismissed the students for P.E., I just hoped they were
ready. Free time, dinner, and (thank goodness) the last meeting of YBB went by
fast, and I went to sleep with apprehension in my heart for the events of
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.5pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>August 13<sup>th</sup> ―The day began overcast, just like my
emotions. I can’t believe how much I was worrying over the final performance.
The day was allotted as the first half dedicated to a rehearsal, then the
second half the actual performance. This event was going to be attended by
local leaders, in front of the entire school, with news crews broadcasting to
local TV stations. But all I could think was whether or not my class was ready.
With a few hours to practice before it was our turn during the rehearsal, we
ran through the Chinese songs. But a night’s sleep seemed to have done my students
nothing for We’re All in This Together, and it still needed a lot of
improvement. I felt as if my voice would almost go hoarse. In the end, as
rehearsal neared and our class still could not successfully sing We’re All in
this Together, we decided to, unfortunately, scrap it. Rehearsal was an
uninteresting occasion, just practicing stage movement and set up without
performance. The real deal was to come after lunch. Strangely, lunch helped me
calm down greatly and I felt relaxed for the performance. The rest of the time
felt like a blur. With each of the classes showcasing their best first, our
class was the last one to perform. Our two level 8 Gu Zheng players, including
Sasi and another girl, stepped out on stage. I started smiling the instant the
first string was plucked. I was held spellbound as the beautiful music from the
Gu Zheng transfixed me in my seat. As they finished―I was speechless. I was so
proud of them. Next were the college students. I watched as the comically
performed actions on stage to the sound of others sing popular songs from China offstage. When they were done, the first act was over. After intermission, each class
performed the rest of their programs. I laughed at the skits, and applauded
over dances and songs. Soon, it came to be our turn to perform. I shuffled onto
the stage and held out the microphone for them as Bing directed them to begin
their song. As the innocent voices of 50 children drifted into the air, I
thought about how this was our last day here, and about the family that I had
gotten to know here. Our songs ended, and a few other classes presented after
us. It was finally time for the high school volunteers to perform. We sang and
danced to I’ll Make a Man Out of You from Mulan, which was our official theme
song. When it was all over, a picture presentation came on and everyone
watched, spellbound, as the two weeks that had meant so much drew to a close.
And though it had started out as a few girls tearfully walking back to the
school, the sorrow at imminent parting soon brought the entire school to tears.
Even I teared up, reflecting on how much I would miss the family I had here, in
Shandong Linyi in a place called Square City, on the other side of the world
from America.</span></p>
