fan or something at night because it is extremely hot. I do like taking cold

the entire day. I also sometimes help my little brother with his homework, and
I know he enjoys it a lot. So I imagine YBB would be the same thing, just for
an extended change and also more intense. I really want to make this special
for the kids. I know this will be slightly tough because we do have a language
barrier between us and the kids, but with the help of the college students, I
don’t think this will be that big of a problem. I’m really looking forward to

trip will be an eye opening break from our normal lives in the US. The rural areas and the completely different living conditions will broaden my view of
the world which I think is very beneficial in life. Often, I hear my friends
talking about how they can’t get some certain item or aren’t allowed to do a
certain activity, but to think they even have this opportunity should be good
enough for them. I mean, I think those thoughts too and often am upset with my
parents because they won’t allow me to do something or get me something.
However, with my limited experience of rural areas in China, our lives in the US are very special, even if we are slightly below average. We live such
privileged lives that we take even the little things for granted. We enjoy
luxuries that we don’t even think are luxuries. That’s why I think this type of
activity is very beneficial for teenagers and college students; it broadens our
perspective of the world. I volunteered at a nursing home once and I talked
with them, asking them if they had any advice about life. Enjoy the little
things. Our lives are so filled with luxuries that we take for granted, if one
day, everything that we take for granted disappeared, we would most likely fail
as a society. When I’m much older and with a stable job and family, I think I
would like to participate in programs like this, or help fund programs or give
money to areas around the world. </span></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:

I am amazed by how much work and effort EVERYONE has put into their lessons. In
the lesson plans, almost everything is described right down to the final
detail. I particularly like the Science and English class lessons. Doing
experiments is a good way to keep the children involved and participating in
the activity. I remember back in school all the boring science lectures that,
for me, were nearly impossible to pay attention too. But, whenever we did
experiments, science class became one of the best classes of the day. Also, the
4 experiments that we have planned are really cool and will be fun to do. The
English Lesson Plan is also good. I don’t think it’s possible for us to teach
them a lot of grammar or vocabulary in the 2 weeks that we have, but allowing
them to be able to communicate comfortable in English will be amazing too! I am
so looking forward to teaching this material to the kids. </span></span></p>

not that bad here, well sometimes. It was really cool in the morning and
hearing all the animal calls and the natural sounds is a nice break from the ruckus
of my life. I was actually really excited for today to start teaching. There’s
something special about volunteering that makes it appealing to me. I remember
after spending 5 hours volunteering at a nursing home; I was dead tired but I
still felt a sense of fulfillment. By volunteering, I was able to help improve
someone’s life. But I think that volunteering doesn’t just benefit the
receivers, it benefits both parties. It’s a growing experience for the volunteers
and a new, exciting experience for the receivers. </span></span></p>

was nervous when entering my classroom. I was worried that they wouldn’t listen
to us or that we wouldn’t be able to explain everything with our language
barrier. But the students were all extremely polite and respectful. They
respectfully listened and stopped talking when we started to speak. Personally,
they acted much more respectful than the students at my school. Some of my classmates
will continue to talk even while the teacher is talking. I’m thankful that the
students here don’t do that. I can’t imagine 4-5 students in our class talking
on and on while I was trying to speak. </span></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:

extremely eager to learn. I noticed that 4-5 students in our class stood out
during our English lesson. They spoke well and articulated well. To me, it
seemed that the students enjoyed picking out their English names, and I’m glad
they had fun with it. Learning a foreign language is extremely difficult. But
they embraced the idea and welcomingly participated in all the activities. We
tried to keep everyone involved so we incorporated a lot of different games
into the class. When we went around listening to them speak, none of them
refused to participate. They were a little shy, but I was glad to see them step
out of their comfort zone. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t that brave when I was their
age. If a foreign student came up to me and asked me to speak, I would not
utter a single word. Their courage and openness surprises me. I can’t stress
this point enough. </span></span></p>

directions and didn’t play games on the computer, but some still did. I can
imagine this is just like what my high school teachers feel; it’s frustrating.
However, it seems that everyone is already familiar with the majority of the different
programs except paint. So today, we mainly played around with paint. The kids
really enjoyed drawing pictures and fooling around with paint. Some of them
drew really nice pictures. The end project will for sure be a success with the
skills these kids have working with computers.</span></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:

horrendous conditions, often homeless and orphaned searching for food. It’s
amazing how happy they seem in all the pictures though. These pictures really
depict the common saying “Enjoy the little things.” Without any possessions in
the world, these kids are happy and enjoy their lives. People like her are
needed throughout the world; people who acknowledge the problems in the world
and strive to solve the problems. The stories she told us seem almost too bad
to be real, but I know they are and these kids aren’t the only ones. Millions
of kids around the world are left starving, homeless, orphaned etc. I liked the
way she showed pictures of the transitions of the kids. From the moment they
arrived at the school, to present day. It really shows how a little kindness
can grow and completely change the lives of a person. These kids went from lacking
basic manners and etiquette, to being extremely polite. What also surprised me were
the art pieces that the students made. The artwork really does show the
patience and dedication these students have to what they’re doing. In America, this determination and dedication would be lost long before even half of the
artwork was completed. I can never imagine what these kids went through. It
just shows how privileged we really are. </span></span></p>

text-decoration:none'>After having one day full of class, I think today went
much more smoothly. However, I don’t think that the English curriculum is
difficult enough for them. All of the students already know the material and
are quite good at it. So I think that for the next few days we might not follow
the lesson plan and hopefully make it much more intriguing or make it slightly
more difficult than before. I remember we asked them which class they thought
was the most fun and most wanted to learn, and it turned out to be English.
With a more difficult curriculum, they might be more interesting in learning.
It seems to be just reviewing right now. I’m really enjoying teaching these
kids. It gives me a chance to lead a group and improve someone’s life. A
majority of the kids are very polite and listen to us, but there are some who
still talk and don’t listen to what we are saying. But, personally, that is
their loss and not ours. If they choose not to listen to us then they miss out
on a chance for them to better themselves. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
think music was a pretty good success today. At first, we tried playing them
the PowerPoint, but class 4 had speakers and they drowned out our music. So we
combined the two classes and had music together. I actually really liked the
PowerPoint because it showed a variety of differing musical genres. For each
song, we asked the class if they liked the music. A majority of the class liked
music that had a good beat, but naturally, their favorite songs were Chinese
because they can understand the lyrics. I think in the future, we should carry
on with the class but at the end combine classes and have like a dance party of
some sort. Energize the students and let them have fun. The only complaint the
students had about the class was that it was too hot. So if we’re only in there
for a short time it shouldn’t be too bad. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also,
Travel Around the World was a pretty good success. I especially liked the PowerPoint
the planning group created. We had the class guess each of the numbers for the
100 people activity. What really is surprising is the number of people who have
a college degree. In 100 people, only 1 person has a college degree. Our class
has approximately 50 people. So we wouldn’t have anyone with a college degree. However,
the YBB program will surely help. In many countries, I think the problem is
that the children lose interest in school; I realize that some students are
forced to work, but we asked our class how many thought they were going to
enter college, and only a few raised their hands. WE told them the importance
of having a college degree and how important a good education is. This program
isn’t about us; it’s about helping the children. Helping them realize the
importance of education, bettering their lives. </span></span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social
Studies was a great success. We turned the pre-test into a game for the
students. Since we have 4 columns of desks in each room, we assigned each
column a letter and read them the question and answers. We helped them
translate each of the questions. We allowed the students to pick a column and
answer the questions. Those who got it wrong could not play anymore, but the
people who got it right were allowed to continue playing. Eventually, we asked
all the questions and had to come up with 4 more, but the kids really enjoyed
it. They didn’t want to take a break. So think this was a good start to
introduce them to American History. I know how boring history class can be.
When it’s boring, the students will immediately lose interest. We’ll strive to
make each social studies more interesting and exciting. </span></span></p>

think today was a really good day again for the students. In English, we let
the students relax a bit and draw while we worked on toughening up the
curriculum. We taught them “I’m a Little Teapot” and hopefully they’ll learn it
quickly. Also, the students drew pictures of their favorite season and their
house. Also, we tried to get the students to complete a family tree but that
didn’t work out too well. /Some understood the idea of the family tree, but
others didn’t really grasp it. But that’s ok; it was mainly for enjoyment
rather than actual quality. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
computer class, the students completed their email accounts, and we recorded
all their emails. I also bought popsicles for all the students in the class
since it was really hot inside the computer room and I figured it would be a
nice break from the intense heat. They really appreciated the gesture. The
student emails will be extremely beneficial for communicating with the students
in the future. If we as the “teachers” can continue to connect with the
students, this will greatly help not only the students, but also us! Hopefully
we can get to the photo editing tomorrow and let the kids draw on themselves. </span></span></p>

the students seemed to enjoy science the most. Since we didn’t have a majority
of the science equipment we needed or the experiments, we obviously had to
improvise. I think the experiment was a good success. It was exceptionally hot
so we decided that letting them play with some water outside would be a good
for them to cool down and have fun. So, we did the experiment and explained why
the cardboard didn’t fall and drew pictures. After explaining the procedure, we
let the kids go out and try it. Each student tried the experiment, and then we
basically just played with water. The girls were really shy, but when the boys
threw water on them, the girls threw water back. It was fun and exciting, and
everyone enjoyed it. </span></span></p>

really like the college student’s project idea. The idea of Emergency Actions
is great! Especially since this area is on a fault line, these lessons will be
important for the students. Our college students are mainly focusing on fire
and earthquake safety and what to do in those situations. Also, I think the college
students are preparing an emergency care kit for our kids that we’re going to
give them at the end of these 2 weeks. </span></span></p>

reviewed “I’m a Little Teapot” again today in class. Maybe once they learn all
the lyrics, the students can perform the song and the dance at the end of the 2
weeks! I think it’d be really cute for our class to do so. After singing, we
had the students complete their drawings from yesterday. Some of the drawings
are exceptionally good. Instead of following the curriculum today, I decided
that we should teach them what to say at a restaurant which is pretty simple.
Tomorrow, I plan on having the students work on a skit for 10 minutes and
present the skit. After that, I want the students to add a third member to
their skit and have a conversation at the table while their food is being
prepared. This will force the students to actually practice the language which
I think is one of the best ways of learning a foreign language. When you are
just drilled with vocabulary, most of the time it doesn’t stick because you
don’t practice it. If we can let them practice the vocabulary that they’re
taught, their English will improve. Also, by allowing them to practice speaking
increases their interest in the language. </span></span></p>

class didn’t exactly work out as planned because the power grid was going
haywire. So both class 3 and 4 didn’t have access to the computers. Jeremy and
I decided to have a class competition to entertain the kids. We had them
compete and do a variety of things. For example, we had the students arm
wrestle, play charades, and spell words in English. At the end, it didn’t
really matter who won (even though my team did) because all the students seemed
to enjoy the competitive atmosphere. Jeremy and I might work out another class
competition next week to review everything we have learned.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

finally got to playing the recorder today in music class. Thankfully, the kids
weren’t too rowdy with their recorders and managed to stop playing after I told
them to stop playing. They got the hang of it really quickly actually which
surprised me. A majority of them could play all the notes except for the
difficult ones like middle C. I think we should probably teach them how to read
music on a staff so we can actually play some songs. But, if that doesn’t work,
I can always write out the note names for them. We told them to practice
tonight so we’ll see how good they are tomorrow. After playing around with the
recorder, Kevin taught them about the different beats, complete with the
quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes. I think the students really
enjoyed today’s lesson.</span></span></p>

the lesson but we can always finish it tomorrow. It’d be a good trivia or
jeopardy game. So we may review all of it quickly tomorrow, then play a trivia
game and establish a winner. I remember back at school, I always loved playing
games because I just love competing with other students. I’m sure it’s the same
here too. After the lesson, we played a game similar to sharks and minnows with
Class 4. I think that we should collaborate more with Class 4 and maybe do some
big group activities to make the classes more fun and exciting for the
students. </span></span></p>

what I can do to make them more involved and interested in our activities. Hai

McDonald is going pretty well. So far I think we have around 15 students picked
to perform it. If needed, I will participate as well and help them out. For
now, we have to start working on playing together and playing on beat. I feel
pretty confident about that. We might also have some performance that involves
our project which is Emergency Evacuation. The college students are thinking
that we should have the students show what they are supposed to do in each
event. I really don’t see how this will actually last 30 minutes, but maybe we
can improve. </span></span></p>

Old MacDonald is coming along perfectly; we have planned to play it twice. The

have some people play and some people sing it. Everyone knows the words pretty
well now, and the notes are all coming out fine. The only problem is that

Practice went fine today, and I think Class 3 did great at the performance. I
really enjoyed all the effort each and every class put into the performance. It
really shows how much these kids have grown. I think the kids especially liked
the college students’ performance because it was quite funny, and they were
able to sing Chinese songs. The only downside to the performance was the
extreme heat. It felt like a freaking sauna outside, and that might have
dampened the students’ feelings. Finally, the video of the past 2 weeks was really

want to leave our YBB family and our students. In these past 2 weeks, we have
connected so well with everyone, not just with the volunteers, but with the
students. Even before the performance was over, students from our class were
crying. It was so hard resisting the urge to join them. When we went back up to
the classroom, all I could hear was the sound of sobs and crying that brought
tears to my eyes too. I didn’t know what to say or do. I ended up telling them
what I felt about the past 2 weeks. I really have enjoyed the past 2 weeks and
have had fun despite the living conditions and the work. Even though the
preparation for each class is exhausting and I wake up every morning wanting to
go back to sleep, teaching class is fun. I knew it was going to be difficult
leaving, but I never knew it was going to be this difficult. Our class gave us
presents before we left. I got a bamboo heart, 2 bracelets, a ring, and a
Winnie the Pooh keychain. By giving these gifts, the students really are
showing how much they appreciated us coming. Every time I look at my presents I
think back to all those times we had together. Even if some of the students
never really listened in class and goofed off, it was all fun. Oh, also, I saw
the 2 girls that got kicked out of our class today. They came for the final
performance! </span></span></p>

when we first went up. The classroom teacher told us that we should get them on
their way home quickly because the weather was turning bad. I bet once I check
my email when I have internet, students will have already sent me emails. I
told them whenever they missed us they could contact us anytime. After my
failed attempt at uplifting the mood, we got everyone downstairs to take a
group picture. I really wish we could’ve taken the picture before this, I even
mentioned it to our college kids but I guess it got jumbled in the mix with the
performance. After our group picture, we tried to send everyone home because
the weather really was becoming worse. But none of the students budged. The
girls were crying, and the guys were waiting. We told them that if they wanted
to go home they could and those that wanted to stay could stay for a little
while. They all stayed. That really touched me. To think that we improved their
lives so much that they refused to go home. If this were in America, the students would have probably bolted at the first glimpse of freedom. But
things are different here. These kids really appreciate what we have done. But
it’s not just us; these kids have benefited the volunteers as well. Since
nobody wanted to go home, we decided to go back to the class instead of
standing in the rain. This return to the classroom got everyone. When we first
were in the classroom, only the girls cried and the guys pretended to cry. But
this time, everyone was crying except for 2 guys. I never knew how much of an
impact we had on our kids. We sang some songs together to try and cheer
everyone up, but that just brought about more tears and sobs. We asked the
students what they wanted to do. Their last and final request. I’ll never
forget what they chose. They wanted us to teach them one last lesson. It was so
hard resisting the urge to cry. Even our strong boys that pretended to cry were
sobbing. All we could do was comfort them and tell them to write to us! If I
have the chance, I will come back and visit each and everyone one of them. When
we asked them to leave, they all refused. One of the girls that got kicked out
sat on the ground and refused to budge. This was one of the most touching
moments in my life. </span></span></p>
