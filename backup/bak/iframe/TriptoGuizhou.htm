        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top>In October 2003, I took a trip to the remote villages 
            in the mountainous region in GuiZhou province, China. This trip was 
            led by a Zigen member (<A 
            href="http://www.zigen.org/">http://www.zigen.org/</A>). Her main 
            purpose was to monitor various Zigen projects, which included the 
            training of the local women for a newly opened MaoPing Village Woman 
            Center. </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top>The villages and its surroundings were beautiful. 
            They easily took your breath away. The locals, almost all Miao 
            minority, were friendly, hardworking and filled with hospitalities. 
            As an AiXin board member (as well as a Zigen supporter), I was also 
            interested in collecting first-hand information on healthcare and 
            health education in these rural areas. My stay was about 2 weeks. We 
            only visited 10 villages and 12 schools, all located within LeiShan 
            and TaiJiang Counties. </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top>In a nutshell, I found out that there is no permanent 
            physician or physician assistant available in any of the villages. I 
            was told that other counties were the same. The following summarizes 
            their current situation: </TD></TR>

              <LI>Access to medical care is unaffordable and inaccessible. The 
              cost of healthcare can easily bankrupt a family's life 
              saving;<BR><BR>
              <LI>Up to 40% of young people (mainly men) go to the city to find 
              temporary jobs. There is a constant and desperate need to generate 
              cash to support their families.<BR><BR>
              <LI>Most women do not have much knowledge about infectious 
              diseases such as hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, etc. However, 
              most of them heard about SARS. </LI></UL></TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top>This finding is worrisome, considering that the 
            number of young people working in the city is on the rise. The 
            chances of bringing infectious diseases back to the villages are 
            high. The urgent need of health education and clinics in these rural 
            areas is greater than ever! </TD></TR>
