<P>&quot;The nation of China is in the most grave moment!&quot; HIV/AIDS is bringing the people of China face to face with one another in this critical time. &quot;China is on the verge of an AIDS catastrophe; the Titanic is heading towards the iceberg.&quot; Thus warns the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in China. "For the truth is, today, China stands on the brink of an explosive AIDS epidemic," The UN Secretary General Kofi Annan also said, &quot;There is no time to lose if China is to prevent a massive further spread of HIV/AIDS. China is facing a decisive moment."</P>

<P>Worldwide HIVAIDS has become a grave public health and social problem. Quick spread, high mortality rate, and severe social-economic damage are making HIV/AIDS a severe threat to the existence and development of the human race. The prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in China has reached a critical point. The number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in China could rise to 10 million by the year 2010 unless the government acts urgently and effectively to prevent an epidemic.</P>

<P>The Chinese government is highly committed to the HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Numerous efforts have been made, and positive results been achieved. However, many problems are yet to be handled. The HIV/AIDS prevention and control faces great challenges and remains a strenuous task for China.</P>

<P>China is a socialist country. Chinese government is people’s government, and we always place the public health, life and safety of our people first. While China is entering a new stage prosperity, we are fully aware that HIV/AIDS prevention and control bears heavily on the well being of Chinese people and on the fate of our nation. HIV/AIDS prevention and control is a concrete illustration of the important policy of &quot;Three Representatives&quot;; it embodies the ideas of governance for the people, humanity as foundation, and respect for scientific outlook. It also shows Chinese government as fully responsible for the development of international community and human society. Government and leaders of all levels should assume a full sense of responsibility to our country, our nation and our people. They need to prioritize HIV/AIDS prevention on their agenda, mobilize all social forces, and put a stop to the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic in China. </P>

<P>A recent questionnaire conducted among mid-level officials shows a lack of recognition of HIV/AIDS issues on part of Chinese government leaders.  Due to their lack of knowledge about the disease as well the prevention mechanism, and an underestimation of the HIV/AIDS prevalence, many of these leaders show indifference towards the problem; some of them even discriminate against the AIDS patients.  The low awareness level of these government officials poses great challenge for the HIV/AIDS prevention in China, which requires &quot;government leadership, multi-sector cooperation, and general social participation&quot;. </P>

<P>A research conducted by the Chinese Central Party School (CCPS) shows that current readings on HIV/AIDS do not live up to the demand of government officials on all levels, who constitute a special yet important group of our society. They need special readings that provide such important information as the HIV/AIDS prevention policy, the relationship between HIV/AIDS and socio-economic development, as well as its impact on China and the world. To meet such demand, the Institute of Social Development Research (ISDR) at the CCPS recruited a group of renowned experts and scholars in this field and compiled this volume: <I>Reading in HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control for Government Officials</I> (CCPS Publishing House, 2003). </P>

<P>We are deeply grateful to the scholars and experts participating in the writing of <I>Reading in HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control for Government Officials</I> (see &quot;Author Introduction&quot;). Their selfless support and assistance made the book possible. They are: Professor Konglai Zhang at Peking Union Medical College (Chapter 1, Part I); Professor Zunyou Wu at China Disease Prevention &amp; Control Center (Chapter 1, Part II, III; Chapter 2, Part II, co-authored with Lin Pang); Jianhua Yuan, Senior Fellow at Beijing Institute of Information and Control (Chapter 2, Part I, co-authored with Yi Xu and Xiaolin Li); Youchun Zhang at Chinese Center for STD &amp; AIDS Control (Chapter 2, Part III, co-authored with Professor Ruotao Wang and Xiaolin Li); Professor Naiqun Wen at the Institute of Enthropology and Athnology in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Chapter 3, Part I); Professor Dun Li at the Department of Sociology, Tsinghua University (Chapter 3, Part II, III, co-authored with Yifang Li); Dr. Feng Chen at the China Office of Family Health International (Chapter 4, co-authored with Hong Chen); Professor Wei Jin at ISDR, CCPS (Compilation of the second half; Editorial; participation in Chapter 1, Part II, III; Chapter 2, Part II, III). </P>

<P>We would like to pay our sincere tribute to the experts who helped us construct the outline and examine the final draft of the <I>Reading in HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control for Government Officials</I>.

<P>To remain current with the changing situation and growing demands, we enlisted the cooperation of U.S. Aixin Foundation in Spring 2004. With their sponsorship and financial support, we published <I>Aids in China --- Strategy and Policy</I> in the U.S., which represents an expansion and revision of <I>Reading in HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control for Government Official</I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">.</FONT>  This book will be distributed to relevant organizations at home and abroad, and used for training of government officials. Both the editor and the publisher hope that people in China and around the world will pay close attention to the AIDS problem in China, and join their hands in fighting the AIDS epidemic.  We hope this book will help disseminate the knowledge about HIV/AIDS among government leaders, raise their consciousness, change their mindset, and assist them in policy-making. We also recommend this book as a reference for HIV/AIDS experts, officials, students and the general public. </P>
