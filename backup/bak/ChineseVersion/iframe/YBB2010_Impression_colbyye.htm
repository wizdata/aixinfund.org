<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>YBB 2010 Linyi, Shandong Province, China</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Colby Ye</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>7/30/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I needed to hang up, but I really didn¡¯t
want to. I just couldn¡¯t bring myself to do it. It was already 8:30, and I
still wasn¡¯t finished packing. Reluctantly, I expressed how much I looked
forward to my visit to Tokyo, waited several seconds after saying goodbye, and
clicked the little red Skype icon. I quickly stuffed my belongings into my
oversized blue suitcase, and moped around the room wondering whether I had
packed everything that I would. After ten wasted minutes, I left with Ms. Zhang
Jie for the subway station, still wondering whether I was ready for the
grueling two weeks ahead. I was already behind my [early] schedule, so I said a
quick goodbye and rolled out of the car with my suitcase. The trip to the train
station was exhausting. I left the apartment showered and wearing a clean set
of clothes, but by the time I had arrived at the second transfer station, my
back was already pricked with sweat. As I lugged my suitcase, which was sagging
under the weight of my belongings, up the stairs to the train station, I felt
my now-soiled t-shirt sticking to my back. I guessed correctly that the group
of about 3 people standing outside the rail station convenience store were
there for the YBB trip, and I joined them briefly before running into the store
to cool off and buy a bar of ice cream. We waited around outside the store for
about half an hour until the rest of the team arrived, after which we headed
down to the train platform and boarded. It was at this point that I realized
that I had definitely packed WAY more than I needed. Picking it up and
maneuvering it between people was a pain that I never want to experience again.
Furthermore, the grime covering the floor of the train station greatly exacerbated
the difficulty of carrying the suitcase because it made the floor slippery.
Fortunately, we made it on the train safely and without any difficulties,
besides the heaviness and clunkiness of my suitcase and the dirtiness of the
rail station. Once we arrived on the train, however, there were many more
challenges, including successfully switching beds with other passengers and
moving my suitcase up on the luggage rack. After a bit of wrangling, Angela
managed to switch with a passenger with a bed above mine, both in column 7 of
the car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The night passed rather uneventfully. Once
the lights were turned off, I dug out my headlamp from the depths of my
suitcase and we played several card games while snacking on food that Angela
brought. After learning a few new games, like 24, a surprisingly fun math game,
I surrendered to my exhaustion. It was difficult, however, because of the smoke
wafting through the train car. Some assholes were smoking on the train, and as
the smoke made its way into the middle of the car, it caused my throat to itch
and sting. No amount of water seemed to relieve the discomfort, but somehow, I
managed to fall asleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>7/31/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After waking up in the morning, Angela and
I ate a quick and nutritionally unbalanced assortment of snacks. We played some
more card games and later headed over to the other train car, where the rest of
the YBB group had stayed. Our car had air conditioning, so we decided to head
back for the comfort. When we arrived, we shuffled off the train and wandered
down to the entrance of the train station, where we took 4 cabs to the bus
station. Once we arrived at the bus station in Linyi, we took a bus with 5
others to the little town that we were teaching in. I was already sweating
intensely, but the bus ride really was brutal. There was no air conditioning at
all, and the only air we got was the dusty wind blowing sand in from the road
through the bus¡¯s open window. I ended up dozing off multiple times because of
a lack of sleep from the previous night on the train. The bus dropped us off in
the middle of a pothole-ridden road. My suitcase got really nicked up as I
dragged it through all the uneven gravel on the road. After arriving at the school,
we set down our suitcases and settled in, as well as we possibly could, in the
office. Pretty soon, we were shuttled off to a local restaurant for lunch. The
food was really quite different. It was nothing like anything served in any
other restaurant. One dish was an entire, cut-up, chicken. Another dish was
entirely animal entrails. We were also given large pancake-esque bread
¡°patties¡±. They were entirely flavorless and very thick. The inside was soft
and almost chewy. During lunch, my sweat had somewhat dried, but all I was left
with were odd-looking white salt marks on my grey t-shirt. After returning to
the middle school¡¯s office, we moved up to the second floor office to enjoy the
air conditioning. It was during the monotonous stay in the second floor office
that I found out how much Angela liked to sing and how good of a singer she
was. I was so anxious for the arrival of the rest of the YBB crew that I exited
the comfort of the air-conditioned room several times to see whether the others
had arrived. After a few boring hours and several wasted visits outside, their
charter bus finally arrived. Although my first thoughts were of excitement for
their arrival, I was also jealous, since our bus was a piece of crap compared
to the charter bus the students arrived in from Shanghai. They actually had air
conditioning on their bus, compared to the hot, dusty breeze that blew in
through our bus¡¯s windows. We stood around for a moment reveling in the
apparent novelty of our comrades¡¯ arrival, but pretty soon, the heat
overpowered our anticipation and we were all forced into the vicinity of the
office. The cleaning process began soon after, with all high school and college
students working to rid the dormitories of the trash that had been spewed
throughout the rooms. Seriously, the rooms had reached a new level of
dirtiness. We found about 5 pairs of shoes, several sheets and blankets, and
multiple shirts and pants, along with hundreds of food wrappers and beverage
bottles. We carted off all of the trash, with multiple trips, mind you, in an
enormous rusted wagon, and scrubbed the plywood bed boards with wet rags. Some
idiot slopped water all over our room¡¯s floor too, so we had to sleep the first
night with water all over the floor. Cleaning took an extremely long time, but
pretty soon, we were finished. At the very least, the rooms were livable. We
walked about 15 minutes to a local restaurant and ate a very crude dinner. It
didn¡¯t taste too bad, but it obviously wasn¡¯t gourmet either. The restrooms
were, compared to the ones back at the middle school, rated 6 out of 5 stars.
At the very least, there was a concrete ditch that had been shaped out for
excrement. It still smelled terrible though, and flies abounded, attracted by
the overwhelming deposits of feces. The way back was rather difficult, since it
was dark by then, and there were no streetlights. We made it back, thankfully,
but some people stepped in stagnant water [while wearing sandals too]. As soon
as we arrived back at the dormitories, I immediately set up my mosquito net and
clothesline, and jumped in the shower as quickly as I could. There is no word
or phrase (not even a sentence or paragraph) that can describe how good a cold
shower felt at that moment. I realized that showering wasn¡¯t actually that
difficult. Even shampooing wasn¡¯t difficult at all. All we had to do, at least
for guys, was to stick our heads under the faucet and wash. The worst part was,
however, that we started to sweat immediately after we finished showering. It
was such a waste of a good moment. Either way, however, showering was probably
the best part of the day. Soon afterwards, I brushed my teeth, organized my
belongings, and hit the rack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/1/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I woke up at about 6:00, without much
difficulty, probably because of the adrenaline rushing through my veins. I
quickly took care of personal hygiene matters and waited around for breakfast
with the other group of students outside the office. Apparently, some of the
girls hadn¡¯t washed their hair the night before, so we were treated to some
entertainment, namely, Angela helping Katie wash her hair. The odd thing was,
regardless of how awkward the situation was, about 10 people just stayed and
watched her wash her hair. They seemed to not realize that it was a bit of a
personal issue. After breakfast at the local restaurant, we started off the day
with some sort of an introduction lecture. Every single subject was explained
entirely, so that we knew how to teach the subjects for the next two weeks. It
was a pretty boring day. Afterwards, we essentially spent the entire day in our
groups, practicing the recorder and preparing for the next day¡¯s classes. I
managed to use the very crude toilets at the middle school. It was probably the
worst experience of my life. I never want to do it again. I would definitely be
guilty of shit and run, because that¡¯s exactly what I did. I prepared
everything I needed for a shower. Right after doing my business, I sprinted to
the faucet and took a long, cleansing shower. We really didn¡¯t do much for
orientation. During one of the introductory lectures, we began swatting insects
with Kenny¡¯s electric fly swatter. It was really fun, actually. I got a real
kick out of waving around the tennis racket-shaped tool and hearing the sizzling
sound of insects dying an electrified death on the metal frame. I distinctly
remember killing an enormous cicada that had been terrorizing the room. I spoke
with Mrs. Teng and Katie regarding my duty as co-MC too. Funnily, when I was
talking to Mrs. Teng, she began complaining to me about everything that was
happening. She first started with all the changes that the school
administrators had been making to the YBB program, like inserting random
lectures into class time. Then, when I thought she was done, she ranted on
about the college students¡¯ proposed trip to Qingdao, instead of climbing
Taishan with the rest of the team. No kidding, it was pretty awkward. However,
I was able to continue typing my journal soon afterwards, and I began thinking
about what I would do to prepare for my role as co-MC. The rest of the night
wasn¡¯t that bad. We spent most of our time planning and reading, and we were
actually able to use the internet on one of the computers in the office.
Everything was becoming a routine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/2/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I woke up in the middle of the night with a
terribly itchy feeling. My knee was swollen with mosquito bites and my right
hand had inflated like a balloon too. After frantically scratching, I fell back
asleep for a little while. When I woke up [for real], my hand was still
swollen. However, I completely underestimated the severity of the situation. I
went through my daily morning routine, with my hand still swollen, thinking
that my hand had just been raped by a gang of mosquitoes in the middle of the
night. However, noticing that my hand hadn¡¯t shrunken in size by the time
classes had started, I consulted the adults. At this point, I began to develop
red rash-like symptoms on my right hand. It wasn¡¯t quite itchy yet, however. In
the middle of English class, I had already developed a nasty-looking rash on my
right wrist, so the teachers pulled Kevin and me out of class to take us to the
local hospital. The hospital was more like a clinic, since the level of care
wasn¡¯t near as advanced as treatment in a legit hospital. Regardless, it was a
relaxing break on the first day of class. When we arrived, we first spoke to
one of the doctors, who instructed us to get a blood test first. The walls of
the hospital were rusted and grimed up, but the nurses who pricked our fingers
still followed sanitary procedure, swabbing our fingers with alcohol before
drawing blood. The blood test went well, so the doctor only prescribed a few
pills for us, along with a packet of magnesium sulfate. We were to dissolve the
compound in hot water, soak a towel in the solution, and soak our hands in the
towel for 30 minutes 3 times each day. The afternoon didn¡¯t bring about any change
in the condition of my hand, though I managed to assist in the teaching of the
afternoon subjects, like ¡°Travel Around the World.¡± We had a lecture, too, but
fortunately, I managed to skip it, citing my hand as the reason for my absence.
I really tried to squeeze as many benefits and as much pity as I possibly could
out of my handicap. By the end of the first day, I felt extremely useless and
tired. My hand begun itching like crazy, and all I could really do was slop
cooling oil over my hand every other hour. It¡¯s a funny thing, really. I
realized that I lost much of my initiative to do anything simply because of my
debilitating injury. My hand was a constant bother for me. The swelling
sensation just seemed to never go away. It became such a pain that I was
constantly distracted from teaching and what was truly important. Dinner wasn¡¯t
too great, but it wasn¡¯t bad either. Afterwards, I spent most of my time
attempting to write my journal, only to hit a wall every time I tried to
translate my experience into interesting text. Everyone else was playing Signs,
an addicting game of secrecy, cryptic messages, and cognizance. In the evening,
we also had a group meeting led by Mrs. Teng. At these meetings, we discussed
the events of the day: the good parts, bad parts, and future plans. My main
complaint about these meetings was the length. They droned on and on about
random, unnecessary information, making it possible for anyone to unknowingly
doze off. For tonight, I set up a tent in the hallway of the office building¡¯s
second floor. Not only was it much cooler there, but my tent also provided much
better protection from mosquitoes and the insects that raped my hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/3/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tuesday morning, my hand seemed to be much
better. However, after awhile, the swelling returned, unfortunately, much too
quickly for my taste. The day before, our group leader had been switched out
with another group member from group 4. Apparently, classroom 4 hadn¡¯t been
able to work together well because two of the college students didn¡¯t want to
teach. At all. Honestly, I found this laughable, but our group agreed to trade
Jeremy for Michael Xu. Now, I was a classroom leader again. I really didn¡¯t
look forward to all this responsibility. I was already burdened with the MC
role, and my hand was still bothering me. The trip to the Fangcheng hospital
hadn¡¯t done much for me, so Mrs. Teng had tokld me that if it didn¡¯t get better
by the end of the day, she would take me to the Linyi hospital the next
morning. I was such a wimp. I desperately wanted to go to the hospital, mostly
because the conditions at the middle school were absolutely despicable. As a
joke, I informed Emily¡¯s mom that if I died, Emily would inherit all my
possessions. To my dismay, Emily didn¡¯t seem perturbed at all. The second day
of teaching didn¡¯t include anything interesting, really. I kept receiving email
updates about my orders from the Apple Store, which was comforting, since I
knew that, at the very least, I would have a brand new MacBook Pro to look
forward to once I arrived in Shanghai. That is, if I didn¡¯t die while in Shandong. Today, I also developed a taste for the local ice cream. Behind the cafeteria,
there was a little booth where people sold ice cream and cold drinks. All of
the volunteers and students would go there every day to buy and eat ice cream.
It¡¯s the best we can do with no air conditioning. Nothing really happened
today. Either that, or I was so behind on my journal that I forgot everything
important that did happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/4/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This time, my hand was legitimately better
when I woke up in the morning. Specifically, I could actually see my knuckles.
Woohoo! Now, I was just waiting to see my bones and my veins. The night before,
several of the girls had moved up to the second floor of the office building as
well, forcing us three guys to move to the right side of the building. Mrs.
Teng was scared that we would rape them or something. So, the three of us set
up our tents/frames outside in the hallway. Very uneventfully, it began to rain
during the middle of the night at around 1:30am. At first it was just a light
drizzle, but enough to wake Arthur and me up. I tossed and turned for awhile,
hoping that the rain would just die down. After awhile, my sheets were beginning
to get wet, so I got out of my tent and quickly set up the rain fly.
Immediately afterwards, the rain started pouring heavily. I heard a few swear
words, Arthur waking up Richard, and the rustle of the two of them moving their
mosquito nets inside. Mrs. Teng even came upstairs to check on how we were
doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>English class today went amazingly well. We
decided to try to have the kids perform skits in class. We weren¡¯t sure if it
was going to be successful or not, since some students still didn¡¯t have a very
good grasp on English and others were just plain shy, but it turned out much
better than we thought it would. Our favorite skit was a scene at a pet store,
with three customers and one manager. The students knew how to use English with
much more ease than we thought they could. Furthermore, they were also much
more outgoing and questioning than before. One of the most common problems in
Chinese classrooms is an unwillingness to speak up and ask questions, due to
the rote style of learning pervasive throughout all Chinese classrooms. This
time, however, students proactively asked us how to say specific words in
English so that they could add them to their skits. Science class was pretty
fun. Even though the experiment and lesson degenerated into a crude water
fight, it certainly was fun. It was definitely better than the science lesson
from the day before, when the experiment only took about 5 minutes, and we had
about 30 minutes to kill. I tried to bail out of the lecture again in the
afternoon, but unfortunately, Mrs. Teng caught us on our way downstairs, so we
were forced to return. I tried to stall for as long as possible by taking my
time while in the office and telling Emily stories, but even she was pushing me
to go listen to the lecture. Once I arrived, I just listened and sang along to
Chris Tomlin songs, and sprayed people with the little nozzle. ¡®Twas quite fun,
though it was still very hot. The lecture finished earlier than planned,
however, so we had about an hour to kill. We started off by playing soft, calm
music like John Mayer and Coldplay, but one of the students, Anna, was adamant
about Angela singing and me dancing. Honestly, I never knew that me messing
around with the students would result in them wanting me to dance. I don¡¯t even
know HOW to dance. But, I succumbed to dancing to the chorus of Bad Romance. Afterwards,
and very spontaneously, Angela and I sang a duet to </span><span
style='font-family:ËÎÌå'>ÃÀÀöµÄÉñ»°</span><span lang=EN-US>. I never thought that I
would be a good singer at all, but apparently I sang really well. At least, it
was good enough for Angela to suggest to me that I sing with her in the final
performance. I really enjoyed it too. The only problem was that I was sweating
like a pig. Several Niagara Falls were cascading down my forehead and face. For
the rest of the afternoon, I didn¡¯t do much else, probably because I was too
tired from singing my heart out. I did continue to sing though. Perhaps singing
that one duet put me in a very musical mood. In the afternoon, we played Signs,
and we continued the rather funny, but sexually perverted routine we had
created. Lunch was especially funny because Kevin Shu continued to creep on
Katie. He actually told me flat out that Katie was both sexy and hot the next
day. Anyways, apparently to satisfy his whims, he snuck up on her again during
lunch, at the suggestion of Andy, Jeremy, and me. He had been doing this quite
often, sneaking up on her and scaring her, at every single breakfast. This
time, he grabbed an apple and dangled it over her head, following her all the
way to the entrance of the cafeteria building. For the longest time, it seemed
like she was deliberately ignoring him, since she showed no sign of
acknowledging his presence. However, she finally noticed, while talking to Mrs.
Teng, and boy, was it funny. The three of us, Jeremy, Andy, and I, nearly
choked on our lunch. Probably the biggest letdown was that my speakers were
half broken. The connection to the left speaker had gone bad, and it required
me to hold it in a very specific, and odd, position in order for it to work. I
suppose that after nearly every single group borrowed my speakers to use in
their classes, they were a bit worn out. For dinner, the YBBers made dumplings.
Mrs. Teng didn¡¯t let me, however, because my hand still wasn¡¯t completely
healed. I didn¡¯t want to either, since I knew it would be deathly hot in the
kitchen. The dumplings were actually pretty good, and I wolfed down two large
bowls. After dinner, I was feeling a bit solitary, so I hit the basketball
court and worked up a sweat. I played for probably an hour or so, practicing my
shots and plays. Unfortunately, I still wasn¡¯t as good as I was in fourth
grade. Jeremy and Angela joined me briefly, but neither of them stayed as long
as I did. I really didn¡¯t feel much inclination to interact with others.
Afterwards, my shirt and shorts were drenched in sweat. In fact, after my
shorts dried, they still reeked. The meeting was exceedingly long, too, and
insects flocked to my sweaty arms. This night, we had several other high
schoolers and college students join us in the second floor principal¡¯s office.
Andy managed to turn on the air conditioning unit in the room, so we were the
only students who had air conditioning in their sleeping quarters. It really
was amazing. Plus, since we had mosquito repelling coils burning during the
night, I didn¡¯t even need my tent anymore. However, it was such a popular
locale that we ended up having about 10 people sleeping in the room that night,
including people on the couches. It really was quite enjoyable, though. Some of
the guys played UNO, and others continued to arrange their belongings and
sleeping areas. It got late pretty soon, however, so Mrs. Teng came upstairs
and practically stalked us for several minutes until we went to sleep. She
literally stood outside our window and watched us as we completed our
pre-sleeping routine. Richard, being the creeper he is, snapped a few photos of
her through the glass of the door. Earlier in the day, we had noticed a
striking resemblance between Mrs. Teng and another teacher, Mrs. Zhou. They
both wore glasses and today, they both had their hair up in the same exact way.
Even their hair curls were identical. Their profiles were nearly impossible to
tell apart. Richard made a game out of it: Find the clone. Anyways, Wednesday
wasn¡¯t a bad day at all. In fact, it was almost good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/5/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Thursday morning was typical, but I was
getting tired. I wasn¡¯t tired of teaching the kids; they were great! However, I
certainly hadn¡¯t been getting enough sleep before, so I was barely making it
through the classes. I managed to teach the English and music class, but I
crashed during the lunch break. I was really glad that we had the Exchange
presentations as the first two class slots in the afternoon, since I knew I
wouldn¡¯t have to do much during the time period. I had originally thought that
I would be presenting my Powerpoint during the Exchange class, but Michael Xu
volunteered to get it over with. The exchange class ended up being very
interesting. Although I noticed Emily nodding off every once in awhile during
the two-block period, I was kept awake the whole time. David Zhang from
classroom 5, Austin Feng from classroom 6, Emily from classroom 7, and Michael
Xu from classroom 8 presented. Most of them had some problems with Chinese
translations of their English Powerpoints. The constant breaks in the
presentation when the student was asking a college student for a translation
were actually quite funny. Secretly, however, I made a note to myself to make
sure to prepare translations before my presentation. I wanted to make sure that
I would waste no time on asking my college student partners for translations. After
all the high schoolers¡¯ presentations, which went by unexpectedly quickly, we
opened the floor for questions from the students in classrooms 5-8.
Unsurprisingly, they didn¡¯t have a single question for us. Shyness pervades
Chinese culture. It¡¯s as if the students are afraid to ask us anything or talk
to us at all. All of us knew that they had questions to ask. None of the
presentations were good or comprehensive enough to have covered every single
aspect of American culture. The students were definitely interested in the
lives of American students, but they stopped themselves from learning more
because they had been trained their entire lives to be fed information, rather
than seeking it out for themselves. As a result, we asked them a few questions.
Disappointingly, none of the high schoolers who presented had any questions for
the local students, so I stepped up and asked about the differences in the
teaching methods we used and the teaching methods their normal teachers used
during class. When I asked if there were any differences, there was a
resounding, ear-splitting answer of affirmation. However, when we asked the
students to explain the differences, a deafening silence took over the room. We
ended up asking each classroom leader to come up to the front to answer the
question. They seemed to enjoy most of the changes that we had brought to the
classroom, like not having to stand up when answering questions, playing games
to learn material rather than simply listening to lectures, and dancing by the
teachers (me). At this point, I encountered a problem. In earlier classes, our
class¡¯s student leader, a rather attractive 13 year old girl, had expressed
interest in Lady Gaga¡¯s music, and she had asked me to dance to it. So I did.
Besides, it wasn¡¯t really dancing. I just kinda grooved to the music that we
played during class because the kids found it funny. When our class¡¯s leader
explained differences between our teaching style and the traditional teachers¡¯
teaching style, she also mentioned that I danced for our class. Mrs. Teng took
advantage of this and asked me to dance for the entire Exchange group, classes
5-8. I was already feeling tired, and I had begun developing a queasy feeling
in my stomach, so I wasn¡¯t too keen on actually doing something during Exchange
class. To alleviate my problem of performing, I demanded that the classroom
leaders also perform with me. We decided on dancing to Lady Gaga¡¯s ¡°Bad
Romance¡± song. However, as expected, none of the classroom leaders actually
danced at all. I tried to teach them what I knew of the dance, as taught to me
by Jason, but even then, they were slow to follow. So, we ended up dancing very
little and we ended up spending most of the time either standing around doing
nothing or trying to get the students to dance. Regardless, it was a
humiliatingly fun experience. Afterwards, my stomach started bothering me more,
so I headed back to the air-conditioned principal¡¯s office to sleep. I slept
through dinner and woke up at around 8:00. Tonight, the rest of the YBB group
went to a ¡°rock concert¡±, going to another small village to hear a presentation
by a civil engineer regarding environmental awareness. Angela, Richard, and I
skipped it because we were all sick. We stayed in the principal¡¯s office and
talked for awhile. One thing I distinctly remember was Richard¡¯s reaction when
I told him I was going to school at Exeter. He literally cursed and threw his
pillow on the ground. Though he can¡¯t really be characterized as mature yet, it
was certainly an odd reaction. He justified his action by explaining that Exeter kids were all just so well-rounded. Afterwards, the three of us bed-ridden high
schoolers watched <i>Step Brothers</i> on Richard¡¯s computer. His computer had
a funny glitch where it wouldn¡¯t stop typing the letter ¡°s¡±. Anyways, we got through
most of the movie before the others arrived back from the field trip. The rest
of the night was just like any other. I quickly went to sleep because I wasn¡¯t
feeling well anyways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One funny thing that happened today was
that a particularly attractive student, our class¡¯s student leader, asked me
for my QQ number. I was a bit surprised. I told her that we didn¡¯t use QQ in America, so I just gave her my email and cell phone number. It was a bit of an ego boost,
but I knew that I probably wouldn¡¯t hear from her once I left Shandong. The
students here hardly use email, and long-distance calling is exorbitantly
expensive for them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Friday morning, I didn¡¯t even want to wake
up. I was so tired. Plus, my stomach still wasn¡¯t much better than the day
before. I wasn¡¯t about to have diarrhea or anything, and I hadn¡¯t had it yet,
but my stomach was uneasy and uncomfortable. If I was given the option to puke
or have diarrhea, I definitely would have done it. I didn¡¯t even eat breakfast;
Mrs. Teng brought me some oatmeal/porridge. For the rest of the morning, I
slept and lay on the couch listening to music. At around noon, I began to feel
better. However, the students had a lecture in the early afternoon, and the
rest of the day would only be spent talking about the project and having PE
class. Our class had a special lecture, though. Throughout the week, one of our
college student helpers, Shang Jia, had been making trips to the city of Linyi to talk with a doctor, asking him to come to our middle school to teach the students
basic first aid. He arrived Friday afternoon, and during the lecture and
project time, we listened to a first aid instruction by a city doctor. In the
middle, class 3 decided to join us. However, class 3 was rather rowdy and
boisterous; there were a few ¡°cool¡± boys that hung out in the back and liked to
disrupt the class. The doctor and his helpers handed out little red first aid
kits to the students and taught them how to properly bandage and take care of
wounds. It was a pretty good presentation, but I left early because I was
getting a bit bored; there wasn¡¯t much for me to do. In the afternoon, Richard,
Arthur, Angela, and I went to the convenience store across the street to buy
some spray guns, with the intention of using them to spray people. While we
were there, however, we saw three plastic pistols, which we bought. We also
bought two packets of BBs each to fire. However, upon arriving back at the
middle school and trying out the guns, we found out that Richard¡¯s gun was the
only one that could actually fire. His spray gun was also the only one that
worked well. So, I went back with a few others and bought another gun that
could actually shoot BBs, though it still couldn¡¯t shoot them very far. Richard
also bought a pair of nunchuks, the crazy kid¡­On Friday night, we had some sort
of a party. In the little area in front of the office, we played music and
danced. After a little while, Arthur, Richard, and I were getting bored. We took
some of the balloons that Arthur had bought at the store and filled them up
with water. While everyone was standing in the middle of the ¡°plaza¡±, we tossed
the water balloons up through the air and into the middle of the crowd.
However, the water balloons didn¡¯t work quite so well, because only a few people
actually got wet. We decided on something a little better. We went up to the
second floor balcony area and prepared some more balloons. I managed to drop
one on Emily and Andy, and Richard dropped one right on Luke¡¯s head. Pretty
soon, we were out of balloons, so we turned to simply pouring water on the
people below us. The people downstairs were dancing, so they made perfect
targets. It worked pretty well; Arthur got Jeremy and I got Katie. We went back
to the principal¡¯s office to chill. However, we watched the movie Dodgeball
before sleeping. It was a great, hilarious movie, though it probably wasn¡¯t a
good decision considering that we had to wake up at 6:00 to leave for Taishan
the next day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/7/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Early in the morning, we left for Taishan
on a charter bus. Some people brought a bunch of stuff; their backpacks were
quite heavy. I only brought a few things, so my backpack was pretty light. Once
we got on the bus, I slept the entire way. On the bus, Christine (Yuan) was
sitting next to David (Chen), and apparently, they had some sort of a thing for
each other. So, when Christine leaned her head on David¡¯s shoulder, everyone
turned around and started snapping pictures. It was pretty funny. We stopped
first at Confucius¡¯s mausoleum. The entire visit was pretty boring. Richard,
Arthur, and I lagged behind the group for most of the way. The only interesting
parts were the car rides. We rode little trolley-like shuttles like the
shuttles at Disneyworld, and the three of us took the back seat which faced
backwards. Richard whipped out his BB gun and we shot at passerby and other
students on the other car. It was amazingly fun. At one point, we shot a black
car that was driving by, but much to our dismay, it continued following us. We
were pretty scared for a few moments, but it soon passed us. The entire day, we
did a lot of walking and looking at rocks, as Richard would have put it. Most
of the time, we couldn¡¯t even hear the tour guide, and we were too tired to do
anything, so we just sat down on a bench and chilled. In the afternoon, we
finally got back on the bus to go to our hotel. Again, I slept on the bus. Once
we arrived, it was dark, and we quickly found roommates and went up to our
rooms. I hadn¡¯t prepared for this, however, so I ended up rooming with the
least popular and weirdest kid in the group, Kevin Shu. For awhile, everyone
expressed their pity, but I had a plan. I would crash in Richard and Arthur¡¯s
room instead of sleeping in the same room as Kevin Shu. For awhile, it seemed
like it would work. We first played a few rounds of Mafia in Jeremy¡¯s room, but
once the other students arrived with drinks from KFC, we all stopped playing.
Afterwards, I got my belongings together and headed off to Richard and Arthur¡¯s
room. We had just moved the two beds together and started setting up stuff when
Mrs. Teng knocked on the door. She instructed me to go back to my room, but
before I actually left, we had an hourlong conversation regarding adolescent
(im)maturity and teenage relationships. It was really rather interesting,
albeit awkward at times. She argued that most people weren¡¯t mature enough at
this age to know what really is love and what isn¡¯t, but she also stressed the
importance of our first love and how it affects the rest of our lives. Through
this, I realized how much more liberal our society has become, and how big the
culture gap in social standards between the U.S. and the rest of the world has
become. I went back to my room at around 12:00 and took the most amazing dump
ever for the entire time while I was in China.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/8/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On Sunday morning, we woke up early,
supposedly to go climb Taishan. Breakfast was mediocre, but I ate quite a lot
just to fill my stomach. Afterwards, we all piled on the bus to leave. However,
it was raining in the morning, so after buying our ponchos and rain gear, we
sat on the bus waiting. Then, after awhile, the tour guide informed us that we
wouldn¡¯t be climbing the mountain anymore. Up until this point, I had already
been wavering between staying at the hotel and resting and climbing the
mountain, opting to climb the mountain to uphold my family¡¯s honor. Once the
tour guide told us that we wouldn¡¯t be climbing the mountain anymore, that we
would only be strolling around some Taishan plaza shopping, I made my decision
and got off the bus. Back at the hotel, there were five students who had
already decided on staying: Katie, Angela, Jennifer, Arthur, and Richard. Luke
also joined me after the tour guide informed us that we wouldn¡¯t be climbing
the mountain. Back at the hotel, most of us slept. All of the girls took the
time to rest, and so did Mrs. Teng, but I was the only one out of the guys that
napped. When I woke up, Jennifer came over to our room to watch <i>Pineapple
Express</i> with us. Prior to that, Richard had been showing us all the
problems with his computer. The funny thing that struck me was that his
computer¡¯s hard drive was only about 70 gigabytes, which is pretty small. We
watched the movie for awhile until Richard¡¯s computer defected. Luke explained
that the computer¡¯s KFC timer had gone off, and it was time for us to make a
trip to KFC. So, the group of us walked over to KFC. We ordered two big buckets
of chicken and several you tiao covered in sugar. I also ordered an egg tart,
which actually tasted pretty good. Angela and Richard ordered on their own. The
KFC was honestly the best food I had had in China up to this point. Afterwards,
we went back to the hotel and checked out of our rooms. While we were waiting
in the lobby, we played a few games of cash, what they called kemps. I was
partnered with Katie, and we just seemed to never be able to get four of a
kind. So, we focused on calling other people¡¯s wins. Eh, it worked okay, I
guess. Mrs. Teng brought us some fruits later, and as I munched on an apple,
the bus arrived. On the way back, I slept again, so I don¡¯t remember anything
that happened on the way back other than the rain. Once we arrived back at the
middle school, I didn¡¯t really do much other than type my journal. One thing I
did do was wash my dirty clothes. Because my hand was swollen the week before
from insect bites, I hadn¡¯t done laundry the entire week. I spent literally an
hour washing about 7 shirts and three pairs of shorts, in addition to several
pairs of boxers and socks. During and after washing my clothes, my arms and
hands were extremely sore. I had never had such a strenuous workout for my
forearms and fingers. Later, I was working in the office at the principal¡¯s
desk after dinner, waiting for the meeting to start. However, even as I looked out
the window at the second floor meeting room, I realized that the lights were
on, but no one was in the room. So, I assumed that the meeting hadn¡¯t started
yet. Apparently, however, they were having the meeting down in the office, so I
didn¡¯t hear anything, even though our window was broken at the time. Before I
slept, I transferred some music from Arthur¡¯s MacBook onto a flash drive to put
on my own computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/9/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I couldn¡¯t wake up Monday morning. I was
just too tired. Eventually, I pulled myself off my sleeping mat and went down
to breakfast. In the morning, I tried to teach a small group of students in a
separate English class because they were more advanced. However, my plan
backfired a little bit. After I had spoken individually to the 5 students I
wanted to pull out, some of them brought some other students as well. So, there
were some students who I hadn¡¯t intended to bring ahead but who came with us
anyways. I had intended to teach them advanced literary descriptive techniques
to help them start writing. Shang Jia seemed a bit pissed off that I was
pulling out a group of students, based on his facial expression at least.
Thankfully, he came with me and helped me teach my little group. Unfortunately,
because I hadn¡¯t intended for some of the students to be in the group, I wasn¡¯t
able to move at the pace that I had wanted to move at. I had to spend more time
teaching simpler concepts than I had wanted to. But, it was still a good
experience, and I¡¯m sure the kids learned a little extra as well. After lunch,
we had an Exchange class in the media room. I spent most of the afternoon
writing my journal in the office building. Later in the evening, we had a
meeting where we mostly discussed Friday¡¯s final performance. Katie, the
college students, and I began to record the performance ideas of each
classroom. The YBB volunteers also began learning a dance for the final
performance. In the evening, as we were thinking of ideas for the final
performance, I had an epiphany. I decided that our class would act out their
interpretation of China-US relations. For the rest of the night, I talked the
idea over with Angela and worked out some of the details. I was so excited for
my idea. Before I slept, I wrote an entire 11 scene skit outline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/10/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For Tuesday morning¡¯s classes, we mixed the
order up completely, and taught the students as was convenient. We taught
history first, in order to help them get a feel and knowledge of China-US
relations, since that was to be the topic of our skit. Then, we introduced the
idea of the skit. The students liked it, but they felt that it was too
difficult. I was very disappointed, because I had liked the idea so much. During
computer class, it seemed like none of the students would listen to me. Perhaps
it was because the college students were gone working on the project proposal.
Either way, regardless of how many times I said a command, no one would do it. Throughout
the rest of the day, we worked out a simplified version of my play. In the
early afternoon, we had exchange class and I presented my Powerpoint. It went
pretty well, and up until the end, I didn¡¯t have that many words that I needed
to ask for a Chinese translation. I took a long time explaining my Powerpoint,
however. Moreover, many of the students seemed a bit uninterested and bored.
Either way, however, my presentation was pretty good. In the afternoon, I
pulled Anna, Steven, Lauren, and Emily out of class to work with them on the
simplified version of the skit. At first, it was difficult to make progress,
but with some time and Shang Jia¡¯s help, we made progress, and I finished the
script later in the day. Tonight, we had dumplings again, but no one got sick,
apparently. For lunch, people were buying burritos from a vendor across the
street. Mrs. Teng was pretty angry because she was scared that we would get
sick, but people bought from the vendor anyways. Apparently, the food was good
to eat since no one was sick or had diarrhea later. After classes finished,
Arthur asked me to go running with him, since he had varsity soccer tryouts
right after he returned to the states. I decided to go with him, just to get
some sort of a workout. I ended up running about 7 laps, and getting a real
workout. Unfortunately, while I was running, I stepped in a little ditch and twisted
my ankle. It didn¡¯t hurt while I was running, but it started hurting much more
later. Afterwards, I chilled and did some ab workouts with Andy and Emily. In
the evening, I worked on the script nonstop. To my inconvenience, I kept
getting interrupted by other people needing stuff from me. I had to give some
people copies of photos that I had taken, I practiced singing with Angela, and
we had several meetings to discuss classes and the performance. Eventually, I
finished everything, and I even had time to finish my journal for the day. The
bad part is, however, that I ended up finishing everything at about 12:06 am. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/11/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Because I had slept so late the night
before, I was exhausted the next morning. Everyone in the principal¡¯s office
woke up late, at around 7:15, after breakfast had already started. The
morning¡¯s classes went by pretty haphazardly. We didn¡¯t follow the set
schedule. We started off by practicing </span><span style='font-family:ËÎÌå'>ÃÀÀöµÄÉñ»°</span><span
lang=EN-US>. My biggest problem was not being able to hit the high notes.
Another problem was that it was typically in the measures that required high
notes that we were required to harmonize. So, every time we had to harmonize, I
kept losing my place and ended up singing along with the other part, all
because I couldn¡¯t hit the high note. If I sang an octave lower, I was able to
sing every note, but it didn¡¯t sound as good. After singing, none of us really
had a clear idea of what to do. We couldn¡¯t really practice our skit, because
the principal had required for most of our main characters to leave the school.
The reason why they had a better knowledge of English, which was why we chose
for them to play the main characters, was because they were older and had
already graduated from the middle school. However, the principal and other
administrators decided that they had to leave the campus. I was most confused
because they chose to remove the students on the 8<sup>th</sup> day of class;
they said nothing for the first 7 days. I got really tired after the second class,
so I headed back to the office to sleep. I slept through the computer class,
but apparently, it was okay because the students were working on their projects
the entire class period. For lunch, I ate what the cafeteria served, but I also
had a burrito before the actual lunch. There was a small booth that was selling
the burritos right behind the cafeteria. The previous day, some other high
schoolers had bought burritos from a vendor across the street. There were just
bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, a sausage, and sauce wrapped in several thing
paper-like sheets of bread. They all claimed that the burritos tasted much
better than the cafeteria food, but personally, I thought it was about the
same. In my opinion, the other students just bought the burritos and said that
they tasted better because it would make them seem different, and by extension,
cool. They were separate and different from the others in that they ate
different food, food they paid money for. The burritos were actually made of
the same ingredients as the food that we ate in the cafeteria. In the early
afternoon, we watched project presentations in the media room on the fourth
floor. I was kinda bored throughout the whole thing, since I wasn¡¯t presenting,
so I just listened to music and worked. Some students skipped the entire thing.
Later, the students watched part of <i>Ice Age 3</i>, and we also practiced the
skit with our new characters. Anna played the Chinese girl, I played the
American boy, and Angela and Julia played the narrators (Angela for English,
Julia for Chinese). We mostly worked on revising the lines and helping Anna
with the English pronunciations. Afterwards, I went running with Arthur again.
This time, we did 5 laps before he had to take some pictures with his group.
While he was taking pictures, I did some upper body workouts on the bars beside
the track. When he was done, we ran 3 more laps. The meeting tonight was short
and sweet, just like the ones earlier this week. We had a pretty long meeting
between the MCs, since we had a miscommunication about how we would be arranging
the programs. Afterwards, I typed up my journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/12/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This morning, I was the last one to wake
up. We had watched a movie (American Pie: The Book of Love) the night before,
and we went to bed just a little before midnight. It had rained the night before,
so all of my clothes that I had hung up on the clothesline were wet. The
morning was spent primarily practicing for the final performance. However, we
had to make several quick adjustments. We had several high school students in
our class. Since they had already graduated, they had a much better grasp of
English than the other students did. As a result, we had wanted them to play
some of the more important roles in our skit. Our skit was to be an extended
analogy of US-China relations</span><span lang=EN-US>. Two of the girls were to
be the narrators. They were actually cousins. We were going to have one
narrator for Chinese and one for English. We had also wanted for the high
school boys to play the part of the man, Mr. America. The only middle school
student we cast was the class leader, Anna, who was going to play the girl, Ms.
  China. Unfortunately, the school administrators decided that the high
schoolers couldn¡¯t continue to come to class. The worst part was that they
decided this on Thursday, the day before the final performance. It really put
us in a bad situation, but we improvised well. After talking to Shangjia and
Boshuang about the situation, we decided that it would be best for me to play
the part that Steven was going to play, Mr. America, and for Julia, a middle school
girl, to be the Chinese narrator. Angela would be the English narrator, since
the narrator¡¯s part required more than a rudimentary knowledge of English. This
was not ideal, obviously. We didn¡¯t want so many of the teachers to be directly
involved in the skit. However, we hadn¡¯t planned for some of our best students
to be taken out of the class with such short notice. Honestly, I really
wondered why the administrators hadn¡¯t pulled the high schoolers out a week
earlier. It would have made much more sense than taking them out a day before
classes ended. In the afternoon, we were scheduled to go to another Exchange
class. However, after speaking with Boshuang and Shangjia, we decided that it
would be better for us to practice our final performances rather than go to the
Exchange class. Besides, the three high school instructors in our class had all
already presented our Powerpoints. We walked Anna through all of her lines and
helped her practice. This time, we also started practicing with the props. I had
to get out my big SAT book that I brought. I covered it with another book
cover, to make it look like it wasn¡¯t an SAT prep book. Our setup was actually
pretty elaborate. We had several important material aids we were going to use
in our skit. In one part, I was going to be a depressed drunk, so Shangjia got
me an empty beer bottle. I kinda wished it wasn¡¯t empty. We also practiced for
our first aid demonstration. I had a pretty fun part to play. In one of the
scenes, a student was getting mugged (and cut on the arm) on his way from home.
I got to play the part of the mugger. Boshuang told me to don a black costume.
She also bought me a plastic, neon green sword and equipped me with a little
bottle of red ink, which I was to spill on the student (Patrick) while I fake
cut him. When we practiced, I didn¡¯t actually spill red ink on his arm, so I
didn¡¯t actually practice what I should have practiced. It was actually pretty
bad in hindsight. We stayed pretty late after the end of PE class working on
the skit. I was really hoping that Anna would be able to handle all the
responsibility, especially since she was the classroom leader too. I was
confident she would be able to do it. In the evening, the MC crew got together
for an extended meeting. Throughout the day, we had been sitting in on classes
and watching them practice for the final performance. Now, we had to put
everything together into a program. We argued, or should I say discussed, the
different possibilities for quite a while, probably because Xiao Yuan and I
just didn¡¯t understand what Jeremy was talking about. Furthermore, Katie was
busy finishing the poster thingy that was to be given as a gift to the school. Soon,
we finished the program, and I printed 17 copies to give to Mrs. Teng. By this
time, I was pretty worn out, so I was a bit peeved when the other guys who were
also sleeping in the principal¡¯s office suggested watching a movie. I adamantly
suggested that they all sleep earlier to prepare for the performance the next
day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
 lang=EN-US>8/13/2010</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Ah, the day of the performance had finally
arrived. Unfortunately, it was also the last day of the YBB program. Such a
bittersweet moment. The morning was entirely dedicated to rehearsals. We were
also encouraged to take our classes out to the stage area where we would
actually be performing. We took our class out to the stage, but Class 6 had
occupied the stage. Annoyingly, they occupied it for the next half hour. As a
result, we decided to head back to the classroom to rehearse, since our
performances didn't necessarily need practice with going on and off the stage.
When we got back to our classroom, class 6 was still practicing on the stage.
In fact, another class had arrived and was waiting to rehearse. At around noon,
I had to go practice my MC lines. I honestly hadn¡¯t given them much thought
yet. I had been more concerned with my class¡¯s performances. Anyways, Jeremy
told me that I was going to open the performance. I had the privilege and
responsibility of introducing the very first performance of the afternoon, ¡°Jasmine
Flower¡±, by Classroom 6. For awhile, I panicked. I had no idea how I was going
to go about introducing the very first performance. I knew my Chinese wasn¡¯t up
to par, and I knew that I hadn¡¯t even seen any of Classroom 6¡¯s rehearsals. Soon, however, I chilled out and thought of a decently humorous opening. I planned on poking a bit of fun at the local government leaders, who would
supposedly be giving speeches before the start of the program. Angela had been
bugging the rest of the classroom 8 teachers and me to go to a ¡°meeting¡± up at
the classroom at around 1:00pm. I was uneasy about ditching my MC duty to go to
a meeting that Angela had called, but I went, with the promise that I would be
able to return to practice my lines immediately afterwards. We arrived at the
classroom, and all the students were already there. I originally thought that
Angela had called the meeting for us instructors to plan some sort of
appreciation gift for the students, so I was extremely confused when I saw the
students swarming in and out of the classroom, apparently preparing something. I
was itching to get back to practicing my lines, but Angela kept me there, and
it was well worth it. Apparently, Angela had called us all up to the room
because the students had told her to tell us. The students had planned on
surprising us with gifts of appreciation. They showered us all with confetti
and presented us with gifts. They gave teddy bears to the female teachers, and
they gave picture frames to the male instructors. Mine was of a Winnie-the-Pooh
theme. They also made roses for each one of us teachers. Despite the crude
nature of the gifts, a result of the students¡¯ relative poverty, these gifts
truly meant the most to us teachers, because of the effort that the students
put in. I took extra good care of every single thing the students gave me. We
took some group pictures, and we read the message the students had written for
us on the board, and I hurried off to memorize my lines. I had planned to wear
my green button down shirt for my MC role, with my purple tie, so I dressed up
and hung out in the principal¡¯s office, enjoying a few more moments of air
conditioning. Richard borrowed my blue striped shirt for the performance. We
took a few pictures together. I decided to wear Katie¡¯s (Kenny¡¯s) hat for the
performance as well. It came with a small catch, however. Before I went up to
the classroom for the students¡¯ little teacher appreciation party, Katie and I
made a deal to trade the hat and tie. However, when I returned the hat to her
for the beginning of the program, she returned to me a very sweaty tie. I was
quite surprised, since she was one of the lucky few who hardly sweat. Today was
hotter than usual, apparently, since the tie was noticeably wetter from Katie¡¯s
rarely visible sweat. I stayed in the office building much longer than I should
have before the performance. I guess I just really wanted to take in as much
air conditioning as I possibly could. I eventually exited the building about 20
minutes after 2pm, the scheduled start of the show. Fortunately, the program
hadn¡¯t started yet, since they were still setting up and arranging things.
Katie actually came out later than I did, since she decided at the last minute
that she was underdressed, borrowing one of the guys¡¯ black button-down shirts.
Personally, I thought she would have been better off with what she was wearing
earlier. The performance went pretty well, though it did get off to an uneasy
start, because Katie left the poster gift in the office. The other MCs, Wang
Bing and Xiao Yuan, called Katie up to present the gift, but because she wasn¡¯t
told that she needed to prepare it, she didn¡¯t have it with her. She quickly
ran back to the office and retrieved it, though it took a few minutes¡¯ delay. My
opening for ¡°Jasmine Flower¡± went pretty well, considering that most of it was
improvised. I had expected that the leaders would be making a few speeches,
which obviously would have been much more boring than our actual performance.
However, they didn¡¯t do any talking at all, which took out a major fun-poking
point of mine. The rest of the performance went very smoothly, albeit with a
few small bumps in the road. One was my botched mugging of Patrick during our
first-aid presentation. I received cheers for my badass-looking black ninja
costume, but I really messed up the cutting part. As I ran up to Patrick,
grabbed his backpack, and tried to fake cut him with the knife while spilling
some red ink on his arm at the same time, I spilled more red ink than I meant
to, on myself. In the end, I covered my own hands with the ¡°blood¡± and only got
a little bit on Patrick¡¯s arm. Even worse, as I ran off with his backpack in my
hands, I covered his backpack in red stains. Fortunately, Jeremy and I were
able to use my ¡°disability¡± to our advantage in our next performance
introduction. We bandaged both of my bright red hands in toilet paper and
opened up the next performance, a gu zheng duet, with jokes about my hands.
Jeremy first asked what happened to my hands. Then, ashamedly stuttering, I
told him that I accidentally cut himself while eating a banana. We then
explained to the students that eating bananas with knives was actually
extremely dangerous. This led into the gu zheng performance with Jeremy saying
that I was originally going to play the gu zheng, but now I wouldn¡¯t be able to
since my hands had been gored up. We heard a few laughs in the audience, but it
wasn¡¯t as well received as we had hoped it would be. Another humorously
memorable part of the performance was Arthur¡¯s erhu performance. We didn¡¯t have
a microphone stand that was low enough to catch the sound from the erhu, so
Katie decided to squat down right next to Arthur and hold the microphone. It
was really quite awkward, but apparently funny enough for her to make it her
Facebook profile picture. The entire performance went well, closing with the
YBB volunteers¡¯ ¡°Be a Man¡± performance and a photo slideshow. Even though it
started raining at the end of the performance, it was still a great success. At
the end, however, everyone was more and more sad. Some of the students started
crying while they were still in the athletic fields, where we held the
performance. I had to put up our props and help clean up the stage area first,
before I headed back to the classroom to mourn with the students. However, once
I arrived back at the classroom, the grieving was already in full swing.
Shangjia and Boshuang had given ¡°speeches¡± telling the students how they had to
continue the learning process that we had begun, in order to reach their full
potential in the future. I realized several things in this depressing moment.
First, we learned just as much from the students, if not more, than we taught
them. Not only did we learn how to live beneath our means, with minimal
resources in a rural environment, but we also learned to thrive in these
conditions. The first few days were rough, especially with my seemingly
diseased hand, but we got ¡°used to it.¡± Other than learning to cope with a
rough physical environment, we also learned an immense amount from the students
themselves. We experienced what the students experienced, and we learned about
their daily lives. Even more, we were able to get close and up front with their
lives, since we were living with them. We learned about the differences between
the Chinese culture and American culture, and we even discerned the little
irregularities in the local culture. Second, I realized that Chinese culture is
much more emotionally expressive of sadness than American culture. The students
were literally bawling on Friday evening because of our imminent departure. Even
the boys were weeping. One boy, a studmuffin with an earring in his left ear,
was crying especially hard. It would have been such an odd sight to see in America, a group of 8<sup>th</sup> grade boys bawling. At my farewell party before I moved
to Boston, my friends were all sad to watch me leave. However, I don¡¯t remember
anyone crying. This isn¡¯t because my friends don¡¯t care about me. Rather, they
focused on the future and wished me good luck instead of reminiscing about all
the memorable moments from the past. Perhaps this is the key difference between
Chinese and American culture. Maybe Americans are more future-oriented than
Easterners. Or, maybe Chinese people are just much more caring than us Westerners.
I don¡¯t know, but the difference was quite noticeable to me. Angela kept asking
me why I wasn¡¯t crying, as if she thought I was some heartless fool. After
signing shirts and trading contact information, the students had to leave,
because a big storm was approaching. At the party later in the evening, I felt
oddly ¡°out of it.¡± Perhaps it was because of the depressing experience earlier.
Either way, I wasn¡¯t in a party mood at all, though I did carry an entire
chicken up to the principal¡¯s office to eat by myself, leaving only the neck
portion for Arthur. It sure did taste good. I fell asleep at around 12:00, and
woke up at around 2:00am. These two hours managed to carry me through the rest
of the night and part of the next morning. I watched <i>Hitch</i> after I woke
up, right up until the rest of the guys woke up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As I walked back from my morning shower and
tooth-brushing, I saw some of our students hanging around outside the
cafeteria. I was very happily surprised. Before we left, Angela and I took
pictures with our students, and gave them our addresses again. They were just
so cute. It was such a nice surprise to see them in the morning. Plus, I knew
that some of them lived pretty far from the school, so it meant a lot to see
them at the school so early in the morning. Before our buses actually departed,
we had another crying festival. This time, with the realization that this would
probably be the last time I¡¯d ever see our beloved kids again, tears welled up
in my eyes. For me, it was most difficult to stop my tears watching the
students from the back of the bus.</span></p>
