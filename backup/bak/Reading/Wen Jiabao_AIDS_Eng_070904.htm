<P>The International AIDS Conference will soon open in Thailand. This shows that the international community attaches great importance to the spread, prevention, and control of AIDS. As a large developing nation, our country has the responsibility and obligation to make its contributions to preventing and controlling AIDS in Asia and the world at large.</P>

<P>I. Governments at all levels and the whole society must attach great importance to AIDS prevention and control </P>

<P>AIDS is a major public health and social issue with global implications. AIDS spreads quickly, causes high death rates, wreaks havoc with economies and societies, and seriously threatens mankind's survival and development. Our country reported its first AIDS cases in 1985. Last year, the Ministry of Health conducted an epidemiological survey with the technical support of UNAIDS and the World Health Organization. The results show that, nationwide, there are now some 840,000 HIV carriers, including some 80,000 AIDS patients, who are mainly concentrated in rural areas. In recent years, AIDS has spread quickly and widely, giving rise to quite serious outbreaks in some areas and spreading from high-risk groups to ordinary people. The serious impact of the spread of AIDS on economic and social development in some areas has begun to show. Our country is in a crucial period in terms of AIDS prevention and control.</P>

<P>The Chinese government attaches great importance to AIDS prevention and control. It has designated AIDS as one of three communicable diseases for prevention and control on a priority basis and has drawn up a series of policies and measures in this regard. After many years of efforts, our country's AIDS prevention and control has shown positive results. Many AIDS patients have received medical treatment; the families of those infected with the virus and those suffering from the disease have received assistance; and the disease has been brought under some control. As AIDS prevention and control goes, there are still many problems that warrant urgent attention, however. Chief among them are less-than-extensive propaganda and education, a less-than-sound epidemic-monitoring system, and weak technical means and prevention-and-control resources. Our country's huge population, uneven economic and social development in various regions, backward medical and health conditions in rural areas, and poor health awareness and legal awareness among the people have made prevention and control more difficult. Our country faces an extremely dire situation and extremely formidable tasks in AIDS prevention and control.</P>

<P>We are a socialist country, and our government is the people's government. We must always give top priority to the people's health, lives, and safety. Our country has embarked on a new development stage in which it is seeking to build a well-off society [xiao kang she hui] in an all-around manner, and raising the whole nation's ideological, moral, scientific, cultural, and health standards is an important goal for us. We must fully recognize that AIDS prevention and control has a bearing on the Chinese nation's quality and the country's rise and fall. Effective AIDS prevention and control is a concrete expression of the practice of the important thinking of the "Three Representations" [Chinese: san ge dai biao; on the importance of the communist party in modernizing the nation representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces, the direction of advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people] and governance for the people; the adoption of a people-centred, scientific development view; and the Chinese government's responsible attitude towards the international community and mankind's survival and development. Governments at all levels must act in a spirit of being highly responsible towards the country, nation, and people; incorporate AIDS prevention and control into the important agendas of government work; and mobilize and organize all resources in society to exercise prevention and control in a down-to-earth manner and to resolutely curb the spread of AIDS in our country.</P>

<P>II. Correct guiding principles must be upheld in AIDS prevention and control </P>

<P>In light of our national conditions and the experience of various localities in practice, we need to define and adhere to the following principles in order to exercise effective prevention and control:</P>

<P>(1) Giving priority to prevention, combining prevention and control, and taking a comprehensive approach. Giving priority to prevention has long been our country's overall principle for health- related work; it is also a basic measure for controlling the spread of AIDS. Combining prevention and control means attending to prevention on the one hand and administering treatment on the other. Taking a comprehensive approach means tackling both the immediate causes and root causes of the problem. It means initiating behavioural intervention as necessary with high-risk groups and disseminating prevention-related knowledge among the general public; resolutely preventing transmission through blood and effectively controlling other means of transmission - transmission from intravenous drug use, transmission through sex, and mother-to- infant transmission; and improving medical treatment and comprehensively implementing various prevention-and-control measures.</P>

<P>(2) Upholding the government's leading role, promoting interagency cooperation, and encouraging participation by the whole society. The government's organization and leadership are important guarantees for effective AIDS prevention and control. We must give play to the government's leading role and mobilize adequate resources and manpower in prevention and control to tackle this major public-health issue. AIDS prevention and control involves many departments. Relevant departments must discharge their duties, attend to their areas of responsibility, and make concerted and joint efforts. AIDS threatens every individual and family. AIDS prevention is the joint responsibility of the whole society. We must guide resources in all sectors of society towards extensive participation in order to foster joint action and a good social environment for AIDS prevention and control.</P>

<P>(3) Carrying out prevention and control in accordance with the law and through scientific means. Legal institutions and science are the basic guarantees for effective AIDS prevention and control. We must continuously improve relevant laws and regulations, heighten the awareness of prevention and control in accordance with the law, and tighten law-enforcement supervision in order to place AIDS prevention and control on a legal footing and ensure the orderly conduct of prevention-and-control work. To defeat AIDS, we must ultimately rely on science and technology. To prevent and control AIDS, we must pay attention to applying science and technology, carry out active prevention through scientific means, develop new drugs, optimize therapies, and improve the standards and results of prevention and control.</P>

<P>(4) Giving prominence to key aspects of work, providing specific guidance, and stressing tangible results. This is dictated by our national conditions and national strength and by the characteristic way in that AIDS spreads. There are wide regional differences in the way AIDS spreads in our country. Giving prominence to key aspects of work means exercising prevention and control at key links, among key groups, and in key areas in terms of AIDS transmission. Giving specific guidance means adapting measures to local conditions and implementing relevant prevention-and-control methods, policies, and measures in different areas. Stressing tangible results means doing solid work; emphasizing implementation efforts; lowering the rates of infection, incidence, and death; and improving the health conditions and living standards of the masses in key areas.</P>

<P>(III) Several areas of work that must be tackled on a priority basis in AIDS prevention and control</P>

<P>AIDS prevention and control is a long-term, arduous task; it is also a systemic project with social implications. We must comprehensively strengthen prevention and control at various links, including prevention, monitoring, medical treatment, assistance through love and care, propaganda, and education.</P>

<P>First is strengthening monitoring of the disease in order to gather timely, accurate, and complete information on the development and spread of AIDS. This is the basis and premise for AIDS prevention and control; it is also the best protection for healthy people. We must further step up efforts to build an AIDS-monitoring network and outfit it with necessary testing equipment and personnel. We must strengthen AIDS monitoring, conduct epidemiological surveys of high-risk groups, and accurately keep track of the numbers of HIV carriers and AIDS patients. We must strictly implement the epidemic-reporting system, submit timely and accurate reports on local AIDS epidemics to higher levels, and release relevant information to the public in accordance with relevant provisions.</P>

<P>Second is strengthening propaganda and education and disseminating knowledge about AIDS prevention and control. Helping the masses acquire knowledge about AIDS prevention and control and adopt civilized and healthy lifestyles is a fundamental solution in AIDS prevention and control. We must combine regular propaganda and education with propaganda and education in key areas. We must carry out comprehensive propaganda and education, primarily in villages, small towns, schools, and public places frequented by high-risk groups, to inform the masses of the means of AIDS transmission, AIDS protective measures, and relevant laws, regulations, policies, and measures and to widely disseminate knowledge about AIDS prevention and control. In particular, we must step up efforts to educate young people in order to guide them towards developing good habits and practices and avoiding bad habits pertaining to pornography, gambling, and drugs. Extensive propaganda and education will help cadres at all levels understand the harmful nature of AIDS and maintain their guard; help the masses understand that AIDS is preventable, controllable, and treatable and dispel unnecessary fear; and help the whole society take a correct approach towards HIV carriers and AIDS patients by showing them more love and care and by not discriminating against them.</P>

<P>Third is strengthening behavioural intervention and comprehensive prevention and control in order to make AIDS prevention and control more effective. We must take effective measures to cut off the primary means of AIDS transmission. While drawing on the successful experience of other countries, summing up pilot programmers in some areas in our country, and severely cracking down on such social ills as drug-trafficking and prostitution in accordance with the law, we must implement necessary measures of behavioural intervention with high-risk groups in order to reduce their chances of transmitting AIDS or infecting other people. We must improve the management of blood-collection stations and resolutely crack down on illegal activities involving blood collection and donation in order to guarantee the safety of blood and associated products. We must set up comprehensive demonstration zones for AIDS prevention and control, with treatment and care as the main features, in key areas, in order to explore working models for effective AIDS prevention and control that are suited to our national conditions.</P>

<P>Fourth is stepping up efforts to treat and care for AIDS patients and safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests. We must continue to implement the central policy of "providing four free services and showing care in one respect" [explanation follows] by providing free antiviral drugs to AIDS patients in rural areas and financially strapped AIDS patients in cities, providing free consultation and tests to people who voluntarily test for AIDS, providing free drugs to HIV-infected pregnant women to block mother- to-infant transmission, providing free schooling to orphaned children of AIDS patients, and providing financial assistance to families of AIDS patients. We must improve the system of AIDS medical treatment and service and provide professional training and education on medical ethics to medical workers in order to continuously improve the standards of AIDS treatment and care. Through a combination of medical service, community service, and care by society and family, we must help HIV carriers and AIDS patients enhance their confidence in defeating the disease and work, study, and live normally, so that they will feel the warmth of the large socialist family. We must strengthen the education and management of HIV carriers and AIDS patients in terms of legal institutions and ethics to heighten their awareness of the need to abide by the law and of their responsibility towards society.</P>

<P>Fifth is investing more funds in prevention and control and continuously improving our ability to prevent and control AIDS. In light of the needs of AIDS prevention and control, we must increase financial inputs, improve prevention-and-control facilities and conditions, and guarantee necessary funding for monitoring the disease, buying medicines, treating patients, carrying out health education, and training personnel. Recent years have seen annual increases in the central government's financial inputs into AIDS prevention and control. The state has also allocated special funds to expedite the construction of centres for disease prevention and control at all levels. For their part, local governments have increased funding for prevention and control. In the future, we must continue to increase inputs in this respect. We must establish and improve mechanisms for raising funds through various channels, with the bulk of inputs coming from the government and the burden being shared at various levels. We must, in particular, lend more support to scientific research, expedite research and development on AIDS vaccines and drugs for treatment, and produce a number of safe, effective drugs. We must study and explore ways to combine traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine to treat AIDS and bring into play the role of traditional Chinese medicine in AIDS prevention and control.</P>

<P>Sixth is strengthening international exchanges and cooperation to raise the standards of AIDS prevention and control. The international community has attached importance to and supported our country's AIDS prevention-and-control efforts over the years. More than 20 international organizations and countries have carried out fruitful cooperation with our country in AIDS prevention and control. In the future, we must take a more open and pragmatic attitude, further strengthen international exchanges and cooperation, actively participate in international activities to prevent and control AIDS, draw on and learn from other countries' experience with prevention and control, and share information and carry out technical exchanges on AIDS prevention and control. AIDS is the common enemy of mankind. The Chinese people must join hands with the international community to combat AIDS and protect the world, mankind, and themselves.</P>

<P>The Chinese government and people are absolutely confident and capable of preventing and controlling AIDS and of making more contributions to mankind's ultimate defeat of AIDS.</P>
