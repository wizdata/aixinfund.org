This is one of the villages affected by HIV infection in Henan.)

  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">This is our first time to visit a village in Henan.  We took an overnight train from Beijing to Zheng Zhou, and then a two hours bus ride to DengFeng city.   The world famous ShaoLin Temple is nearby.

  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">When we arrived in the village, we went directly to visit the HIV-infected families.  The first one lived in a dark and cold little house.  This family's only furniture was an old table and a bed.  The host was a spokesperson representing all HIV-infected families in this village.  He told us that he contracted AIDS by selling blood in 1995, and was confirmed to be HIV positive last year.  However, his wife and a three-year old son were not infected.   Of the three hundred households in Wang Lou village, 36 families were affected with HIV (about~10%).  The livelihoods of the peasants were dependent on farming.  In winter, the only income source for them is to work in a coal mine nearby.

  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">He brought us to visit several families.  Some had one adult died of AIDS already, leaving behind an infected wife or husband, and young children.  These children could no longer afford to attend school.  Since their parents could no longer work, some of the children (about 14-year old) worked at the coalmine and they became the sole source of income for their families.

 		<tr>
  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">This village was not qualified as 'high infection rate' area, and therefore only a few HIV-infected victims were able to receive some government subsidies.  They wished that the government officials would pay immediate attention to their desperate needs, just like those in villages labeled as 'high infection rate'.

 		<tr>
  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">The winter in Henan is very cold.  Most peasants could not afford to buy material for heating.  It is especially harsh for those HIV-infected individuals.  One of our purposes for this visit was to distribute twenty to thirty winter coats for the most needed children.  We also planned to buy more with the donations raised in the US.  After consulting with a few representatives from this village, we were told that they preferred to receive the money instead.  The reason was that the Spring Festival was near and they needed the money to buy some meat and food.  The representatives came up with a list of 36 families that needed assistance the most.   Each family would receive about 200 to 300 RMB (Chinese monetary unit, 1$ = 8.2 RMB currently).  Seeing the smiling faces of the children wearing the donated coats, we felt we had delivered a message of care and concern from our donors.

  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">On our way back, we kept thinking that there were still so many HIV victims in many other villages.  They needed help from all sources, especially the government.  NGOs are definitely playing an important role in assisting these victims and we will need more participants.  Please join us in helping these peasants.
