  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">Our two-day visit went by quickly.  The impressions we gained from this trip were a sharp contrast to the observations we had in our earlier trip to Dengfeng in Henan Province.  Our good friend, Xiangmei, who accompanied us on the trip and who has been actively involved in many of the Ministry of Health Services' nationwide demonstrations of community medical insurance programs and medical system reforms, told us she has never seen a model of operation quite like the one we observed in Qianxi.  Indeed, the Qianxi Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion is a citizen-initiated and citizen-operated organization designed with farmers' needs in mind, and is rich in Chinese characteristics and local colors.  It is unique in many ways.  First, under the support of the local government, they actively sought and utilized resources to provide free volunteer services to farmers.  In doing so they created an environment of positive interactions between people and government agencies that produced mutual benefits, and supplemented many services and functions that government agencies were responsible for but unable to provide.  Second, for hundreds of years Chinese people have been accustomed to the idea of seeking medical treatments only when they get sick.  Members in the Qianxi Sisterhood have the courage to challenge that ancient mode of thinking and ancient customs, and put into practice the new idea of preventive healthcare.  They want to lead rural women in China to push forward the concept of a "Grand Scheme of Healthcare for the Society" that will eventually benefit all rural women in the entire population.  Such Country attempts will undoubtedly breathe new life into the difficult situation that the Chinese rural medical care system faces today as a result of a gradual deterioration of the nation's healthcare infrastructure.  Third, in the materialistic society where money becomes the focus of attention of most people, the Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion has created an atmosphere of honor and pride for volunteer work and for public welfare activities.  This is really a remarkable accomplishment.  Finally, the uplift in women's health consciousness and the active participation in social work on the part of rural women represent significant milestones in the democratic and social processes.  The Qianxi experience is broadly compatible with the general direction of progress implied by the "Grand Healthcare Scheme of the Society," and is worthy of recognition and promotion.  At present, the main problem encountered by the Sisterhood is insufficient funds.  Because of a shortage of funds, the Sisterhood is unable to embark on similar activities in more than 200 other villages and rural districts that have less developed transportation systems than Qianxi.  In addition, there are a number of areas where the Sisterhood's work needs strengthening, e.g., more comprehensive use of local resources, more efficient planning and evaluation of some of the projects under consideration, etc.

  		  <td valign="top" colspan="2">In summary, the work being carried out by the Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion in Qianxi is profoundly important, and represents tremendous achievements for rural women.  The Aixin Foundation pledges to do its best to provide full support for their efforts, and will encourage them to make further advances and reach new heights.  In addition to recommending new localities for future experiments, we hope, as a first step, to raise funds for the purchase of a mobile clinic unit for ambulatory psychiatric counseling, first aid and on-the-spot paramedic treatment of women patients.  In addition, we would also like to seek funds for the Sisterhood's training programs for mental health and health education and promotion.  It is our hope that in the not too distant future the near Qianxi experience will be extended to other regions and will create benefits for many more sisters in all rural areas in China.
