          <TD>A shipment of copies of the "AIDS in China" (written in Chinese) 
            is finally arrived by sea from China. For readers who are concerned 
            and interested in knowing more about the HIV/AIDS situation in China 
            and beyond, please send your request of free copy to AiXin's

          <TD>We, AiXin, are hoping that through our readers, would arouse 
            their concern and care about the devastating HIV/AIDS epidemic 
            occurring in China right now. In addition to bear all financial 
            support, AiXin, along with the chief editor and all 
            authors/volunteers, had spent numerous hours and efforts to collect 
            and translate the articles, in order to make this book possible. We 
            apologized for any typing or printing errors that you may find.        </TD></TR>
