          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>Summary: The Qianxi experience is broadly 
            compatible with the general direction of progress implied by the 
            "Grand Healthcare Scheme of the Society," and is worthy of 
            recognition and promotion. Indeed, the Qianxi Sisterhood of 
            Healthcare Promotion is a citizen-initiated and citizen-operated 
            organization designed with farmers' needs in mind, and is rich in 
            Chinese characteristics and local colors. It is unique in many ways.          </TD></TR>

                <div align="justify">First, under the support of the local government, they 
                  actively sought and utilized resources to provide free volunteer 
                  services to farmers. In doing so they created an environment of 
                  positive interactions between people and government agencies that 
                  produced mutual benefits, and supplemented many services and 
                  functions that government agencies were responsible for but unable 
                  to provide.<BR>

                  to challenge that ancient mode of thinking and ancient customs, 
                  and put into practice the new idea of preventive healthcare. They

            <p align="justify">   Qianxi is a county in the mountain region of the western Hebei province. It has 417 administrative villages, with a population of 350,000. For quite some time, we have heard about the &quot;Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion&quot; in Qianxi that has been doing an outstanding job in promoting health education among women in rural villages. Attracted by this reputation of the Sisterhood, we went to Qianxi for a visit on the 7th and 8th of January, 2005. </p>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              Invited to come with us were our good friends Xiang-mei and Xin-sheng, who worked in the nation's healthcare system for many years, and Mr. Jing-shuan Zhang, the vice president of the AIDS Prevention Association of Beijing. We took off from Beijing at 7 o'clock in the morning, and arrived in Qianxi County near the city of Tangshan in about three hours by car. At the training center of the &quot;Sisterhood of Mutual Assistance and Healthcare Promotion,&quot; we held a session of roundtable discussion with more than a dozen volunteer workers of the Association. Ms. Shuzhen Wang, the president of the association, and Ms. Zhao Guofen, the executive officer, gave us a briefing on the history of the association and its major tasks. </p>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              The Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion is a civic organization founded by volunteers of both retired and actively employed workers. There are about 30 female government and party workers, clinical professionals, and psychiatric counselors. They comprise the backbone of the organization. The main objective of the Sisterhood is to promote preventive health education among rural women. Since its inception two years ago, it has developed a program to raise the health consciousness of rural women and organized small classes to teach the fundamentals of AIDS prevention for women. It has established a number of &quot;Sister-to-Sister Healthcare Assistance Teams&quot; which now boast more than 10,000 women members. Through interactive training sessions, distribution of simple, easy-to-understand disease prevention and treatment manuals that the sisters compiled themselves, and the setting up of psychiatric counseling hotlines, the core members of the Qianxi Sisterhood first taught basic medical knowledge to 200 healthcare assistance team captains selected from various rural districts and villages. Then, through these team captains, the Sisterhood put in place a county-wide program of preventive healthcare training that now includes 10,000 women members. At the same time, it also established a network of free first-aid stations specifically for the treatment of gynecological diseases. Through such a program, the Sisterhood is able to raise the health consciousness of rural women and the awareness of healthy body and mind for the entire population. The health education is aimed at grass-root participants, and its content is geared specifically to the needs of the farmers. As a result, basic medical knowledge is passed on deep into each rural community, to each individual farm and rural household. There was a high and active level of participation on the part of the villagers. </p>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              On the second day of our Qianxi visit, we went to the Yinzhuang Rural District to observe the training activity of local healthcare assistance teams. Reflecting on the actual local conditions, the two doctors from the Qianxi Sisterhood gave two lectures: &quot;Symptoms of and Preventive Precautions against the epidemic hemorrhagic fever&quot; and &quot;What is the HIV/AIDS?&quot; In the lectures they first talked about the symptoms of the disease, then about its channels of transmission and methods of prevention. After the lectures, the doctors asked participants questions in order to drive home the points included in the lectures. Although the outside was frigidly cold, the thirty-some sisters inside sat in a circle and listened attentively, took meticulous notes, and showed a remarkable degree of interest and enthusiasm. After the lectures, the participating sisters performed a skit they wrote and directed themselves, and used it as a method of teaching villagers the basic knowledge of healthcare and disease prevention through the medium of entertainment. For example, in one act a mother passed on to her daughter who is about to go to the city to find work her newly acquired knowledge of AIDS prevention. In another act, the skit showed how female villagers acquired more knowledge about menopause through the Sisterhood classes, and actively made adjustments in dealing with their family members. The skit was humorous, good-natured, and conveyed important health-related messages in a light-hearted setting. We were thoroughly impressed with the lively spirits and poised demeanor of the village sisters. </p>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              Both Ms. Shuzhen Wang, the president of the Qianxi Sisterhood, and Ms. Guofen Zhao, the chief executive officer, grew up in rural villages in Qianxi County. They have worked in jobs related to rural women for well over a decade. They have a deep understanding of farmers' needs, and a strong desire for rural reforms: to improve rural women's livelihood, and to change these women's perception of value and their fundamental way of thinking. Ask them what is feared most in rural communities, and they will tell you it is to be affected by a prolonged illness. If one person in the family contracts an illness and needs medical treatment for a long period of time, it would ruin the family's economic means and hamper the family's ability to provide education to other members. Poverty resulting from prolonged illnesses is a widespread phenomenon in rural areas. In this regard, the Sisterhood has made all strength for this central task to heighten the awareness of healthcare issues among women, and made a series of proposals to achieve the goal. It popularized the slogan &quot;to make a woman healthy is to make a family healthy,&quot; put in place the &quot;awakening of health consciousness&quot; programs, encouraged rural women to &quot;participate, interact, assist each other, and share&quot; in health related matters, opened hotlines for mental health counseling, published &quot;Sisters' Health Bulletins,&quot; and organized free healthcare clinics. It promoted a program of &quot;improving the sanitary environment of rural households&quot;, advocated the usage of methane tanks, and changed the unsanitary habits of having live poultry run around the house, leaving their feces all over the place, and of family members bathing only once or twice for the whole winter. Their actions have greatly improved the hygiene conditions of rural families. In view of the psychological inhibitions of rural women to talk about genital diseases, the Sisterhood ventured deep into the villages and households to conduct health surveys and free clinics while keeping their counseling hotlines in operation, and popularized the slogan &quot;healthiness for oneself means happiness for the whole family.&quot; It also used on-the-spot visits and frank conversations to allay village women's fears and inhibitions. At present, the health hotline has become a welcome tool by more and more women in rural villages. Everyone now feels comfortable with the system and considers the office of the Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion a place where one can talk to other fellow villagers heart-to-heart. </p>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              The Sisterhood has a coterie of selfless and dedicated medical staff who works as volunteers. Dr. Zuoxin Wu, the 68-year old retired chief of the clinical laboratory at the county hospital, and his wife, chief obstetrician and gynecologist at the same hospital, did not want to go to the United States after their retirement to live a comfortable life with their son, declined other high-paying post-retirement job offers elsewhere, and proudly chose to remain at the county hospital as volunteer medical professionals. Dr. Wu told us that the volunteer work has helped him and his wife to realize the full value of their lives and has enriched their retirement spiritually. The general secretary of the Sisterhood, Ms. Yonghong Zhou, 47, is a quiet and bookish person with many talents. She was a member of a military performing troupe for nine years before she came to Qianxi with her husband. During the years since she came, she has overcome many difficulties and completed required courses for a college degree through self-studies. In 2003, at her own expense, she took and passed the national qualifying examinations for psychiatric counselors, was awarded the qualifying certificate, and became the first psychiatric counselor that came from a rural area and went back to serve the same area. In order to immerse fully in the work she loved and to serve more sisters in rural communities, she made early resigning from her government job and opened a psychiatric counseling office with borrowed money. She set up telephone hotlines so that her rural sisters who have family and health-related problems can have frank and uninhibited discussions with her when they need professional advice. </p>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              Our two-day visit went by quickly. The impressions we gained from this trip were a sharp contrast to the observations we had in our earlier trip to Dengfeng in Henan Province. Our good friend, Xiangmei, who accompanied us on the trip and who has been actively involved in many of the Ministry of Health Services' nationwide demonstrations of community medical insurance programs and medical system reforms, told us she has never seen a model of operation quite like the one we observed in Qianxi. Indeed, the Qianxi Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion is a citizen-initiated and citizen-operated organization designed with farmers' needs in mind, and is rich in Chinese characteristics and local colors. It is unique in many ways. First, under the support of the local government, they actively sought and utilized resources to provide free volunteer services to farmers. In doing so they created an environment of positive interactions between people and government agencies that produced mutual benefits, and supplemented many services and functions that government agencies were responsible for but unable to provide. Second, for hundreds of years Chinese people have been accustomed to the idea of seeking medical treatments only when they get sick. Members in the Qianxi Sisterhood have the courage to challenge that ancient mode of thinking and ancient customs, and put into practice the new idea of preventive healthcare. They want to lead rural women in China to push forward the concept of a &quot;Grand Scheme of Healthcare for the Society&quot; that will eventually benefit all rural women in the entire population. Such Country attempts will undoubtedly breathe new life into the difficult situation that the Chinese rural medical care system faces today as a result of a gradual deterioration of the nation's healthcare infrastructure. Third, in the materialistic society where money becomes the focus of attention of most people, the Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion has created an atmosphere of honor and pride for volunteer work and for public welfare activities. This is really a remarkable accomplishment. Finally, the uplift in women's health consciousness and the active participation in social work on the part of rural women represent significant milestones in the democratic and social processes. The Qianxi experience is broadly compatible with the general direction of progress implied by the &quot;Grand Healthcare Scheme of the Society,&quot; and is worthy of recognition and promotion. At present, the main problem encountered by the Sisterhood is insufficient funds. Because of a shortage of funds, the Sisterhood is unable to embark on similar activities in more than 200 other villages and rural districts that have less developed transportation systems than Qianxi. In addition, there are a number of areas where the Sisterhood's work needs strengthening, e.g., more comprehensive use of local resources, more efficient planning and evaluation of some of the projects under consideration, etc. </p>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              In summary, the work being carried out by the Sisterhood of Healthcare Promotion in Qianxi is profoundly important, and represents tremendous achievements for rural women. The Aixin Foundation pledges to do its best to provide full support for their efforts, and will encourage them to make further advances and reach new heights. In addition to recommending new localities for future experiments, we hope, as a first step, to raise funds for the purchase of a mobile clinic unit for ambulatory psychiatric counseling, first aid and on-the-spot paramedic treatment of women patients. In addition, we would also like to seek funds for the Sisterhood's training programs for mental health and health education and promotion. It is our hope that in the not too distant future the near Qianxi experience will be extended to other regions and will create benefits for many more sisters in all rural areas in China. <br>
