          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>(Editor's note: On January 5, 2005, with 
            the help from Dr. Gao Yaojie and Mr. Hu Jia, AiXin representatives 
            Hu Chuanshuo and Weng Yongkai visited Wang Lou village in DengFeng 
            County of Henan Province. This is one of the villages affected by 
            HIV infection in Henan.) </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>This is our first time to visit a village 
            in Henan. We took an overnight train from Beijing to Zheng Zhou, and 
            then a two hours bus ride to DengFeng city. The world famous ShaoLin 
            Temple is nearby. </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>When we arrived in the village, we went 
            directly to visit the HIV-infected families. The first one lived in 
            a dark and cold little house. This family's only furniture was an 
            old table and a bed. The host was a spokesperson representing all 
            HIV-infected families in this village. He told us that he contracted 
            AIDS by selling blood in 1995, and was confirmed to be HIV positive 
            last year. However, his wife and a three-year old son were not 
            infected. Of the three hundred households in Wang Lou village, 36 
            families were affected with HIV (about~10%). The livelihoods of the 
            peasants were dependent on farming. In winter, the only income 
            source for them is to work in a coal mine nearby. </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>He brought us to visit several families. 
            Some had one adult died of AIDS already, leaving behind an infected 
            wife or husband, and young children. These children could no longer 
            afford to attend school. Since their parents could no longer work, 
            some of the children (about 14-year old) worked at the coalmine and 
            they became the sole source of income for their families. </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>This village was not qualified as 'high 
            infection rate' area, and therefore only a few HIV-infected victims 
            were able to receive some government subsidies. They wished that the 
            government officials would pay immediate attention to their 
            desperate needs, just like those in villages labeled as 'high 
            infection rate'. </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>The winter in Henan is very cold. Most 
            peasants could not afford to buy material for heating. It is 
            especially harsh for those HIV-infected individuals. One of our 
            purposes for this visit was to distribute twenty to thirty winter 
            coats for the most needed children. We also planned to buy more with 
            the donations raised in the US. After consulting with a few 
            representatives from this village, we were told that they preferred 
            to receive the money instead. The reason was that the Spring 
            Festival was near and they needed the money to buy some meat and 
            food. The representatives came up with a list of 36 families that 
            needed assistance the most. Each family would receive about 200 to 
            300 RMB (Chinese monetary unit, 1$ = 8.2 RMB currently). Seeing the 
            smiling faces of the children wearing the donated coats, we felt we 
            had delivered a message of care and concern from our donors. </TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD vAlign=top colSpan=2>On our way back, we kept thinking that 
            there were still so many HIV victims in many other villages. They 
            needed help from all sources, especially the government. NGOs are 
            definitely playing an important role in assisting these victims and 
            we will need more participants. Please join us in helping these 
            peasants. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
