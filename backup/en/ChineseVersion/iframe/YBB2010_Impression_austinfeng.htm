<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>7/31 每 Our trip to Shanghai has finished;
it has been a very interesting experience. In the morning, I woke up early to
get packed up. In the main lobby, everyone was prepared to leave. The YBB p.
arrived. At about 8:00, everyone fit into the rented tour bus and got on the
road. There were three stops, on the way we all played many games. At 3:00 每
9:00, we arrived at Shandong. It was surprising to find banners welcoming us to
the school. I was in great shock in discovering the very filthy conditions the
dorms were in. It is very perplexing how so much trash could collect under the
bunk bed. At once everyone got to work to clean up. My job was to wash the dust
and dirt off the bunk bed planks. While working, obviously, I sweated a lot,
but with the extreme heat, I was really sweating like crazy. After all four
rooms were clean; everyone decided to wash the planks directly under water.
After 2 hours of hard work, we were finally finished. About .25 to .5 miles
away, we ate dinner at a Shandong restaurant. There was a big bowl of tomato
egg soup, cabbage soup, and a really big piece of bread. At night, the rooms
only seemed hotter; they had no A/C or fans, the only appliance was a single
light bulb. Washing was quite unique. We had no shower stalls, only a single
sink with a hose. In the end, everyone took showers in their pants and boxers.
The water was also extremely cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/1 每 I had the worst sleep I have ever had
yesterday night. There is a lump in the plank in my bunk and it hurts to turn
to one＊s side. We ate breakfast at the same place we ate dinner last night. And
as expected from our previous experience, the mantou were quite large.
Everyone, after having breakfast, went to the 2F classroom to have an
orientation of the lesson plans. Everyone＊s plans sounded very good, but I fear
some concepts may be too difficult for us to teach in Chinese. Following this
meeting, we went to lunch at the cafeteria. Strangely 80% of the building was
filled with empty bunks. Also we had to stand while eating. We ate very big
mantou, xia chai, and a bowl of meat, cucumber, fungus, and broth. I think no
table was able to finish it. It started to rain and after three stop-go
sessions of table-tennis and badminton, we left for recorder lessons. The recorders
didn＊t have good quality and some didn＊t work, but they sufficed. It surprised
me that though most of YBB (I think) know music, we learned no sharps or flats.
At dinner, we were served porridge, some vegetables, and some unknown soup; we
also had some very good watermelon. The final meeting was created in regard to
the lack of computer space tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/2 每 First day of teaching students. I
woke up early in the morning to wash my clothes and take a shower. The shower
was the coldest one I have ever taken. At about 8:00, my group and I went to
our classroom. The students were much younger (physical) than I had expected.
Everyone was quite enthusiastic about our arrival and the class and we quickly
became friends. After warming up the class, we left for the welcoming ceremony.
The main speakers were Mrs. Teng, the Aixin p, the principle of the school, the
secretary of fexian, their student representative, and Katie, ours. During the
30 min period, three students had a reaction to the mosquitoes＊ bites and their
hands swelled up pretty bad. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>English 每 E. class was quite good. We were
able to give all the kids English names and teach them basic American manners.
I＊m surprised that they already know so much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Music 每 M. class was very simple. All that
we did was play music from around the world</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Computer 每 Even easier, most of the
children knew how to use ppt and we＊re just going to start the ※my life§ ppt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although some things have not all gone
according to plans, I believe today was a good start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/3 每 I woke up in the morning at 5:30.
After washing my clothes and cleaning up and eating breakfast, we went to
class. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>English 每 class was pretty interesting. We
had the students act out each letter of the alphabet. My only concern was that
we didn＊t really teach anything or follow the plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Science 每 science was rather unfortunate.
When we showed the students concave and convex lens, they told us they had
learned everything already. So we had to have yozi ab-lib something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>History 每 History was better than science.
Richard and I talked about the history of the beginning of America. We did okay, but once again yozi had to help us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/4 每 Unfortuntly I could not find my
journal, but I was able to borrow some paper from Peter. The day started with
my waking up to the boom of thunder and flash of lighting. People yesterday had
predicted there was going to be a thunderstorm, but no one predicted any thing
as massive as this. Everyone believed and hoped that school would be canceled,
but during breakfast, the rain stopped and school continued. English was new,
Richard decided to teach them ※I＊ve gotta feeling.§ It was a good idea to
introduce these children to English in lyrics, but does it teach them anything
worthwhile? Our second class was music, I taught it and it was like hell. After
giving these kids recorders, they never stopped blowing. It was quite hard
trying to teach, but I still was able to teach them the basics. The rest of the
school day was pretty normal; history, Richard and I handled, computer, we left
to yozi and Derek, P.E. was switched with project so the kids could get the
rackets and balls. Dinner was fun. We had dumplings, which many of made. They
were very good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/5 每 I was able to find my journal, but I
like the fell of writing on this paper better, so I will continue to write
stuff here. The day began normally, with Richard, Christine, and I teaching the
entire class together, with no organized plan. Mr. Cheng came in and took over
teaching when we had some issues. Richard and Mr. Cheng got into an altercation
over teaching. When I got back, Richard had returned since he was sick. I took
over recorder class and frankly, it was quite successful. I split the class in
half and took them out-side with them, and then I worked one-on-one to fix the
students＊ problems. I believe it helped me connect with the students better.
Unfortunately, when we left for lunch, we got a massive berating from yozi for
not being prepared; we immediately started to prepare. Next was exchange, where
we shared our ppts. It was fun and interesting, Michael, David, Emily and I
presented that day. For dinner, we had some very tasty chicken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/6 每 One more day before qufu and taishan,
meaning hotels, meaning real toilets and showers. After yozi berated us, we
began taking things into our own hands. For English, Christine led the class in
singing ※I gotta feeling§ and we had the class act out a skit, in English,
depicted ordering food. For recorder class, I did what I did before. I believe
it was quite successful; most of the students got it. During break, David,
Michael, and I tried to play CS in the computer lab. However the computer
didn＊t work so we just played some flash games. At dinner, we had some very
tasty baozi. Before dinner, the college kids left for qingdao. At the end of
the day, we had a party/meeting. There was some orange soda that really messed
up my stomach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/9 每 We arrived back from taishan and qufu
and the college kids arrived back from qingdao. At midnight, when the c. kids
just arrived, they brought back a lot of food and we had a giant snacking
party. There was roasted chicken that was very good. When we started class, we
got the bad news, yozi was sick and so half of our ※manpower§ was gone.
Fortunately, our classes didn＊t go too bad. The only real issue was when
Richard tried to teach the class how to dance, no girl listened and the boys
didn＊t understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/10 每 Everyone＊s back on track and things
are resuming as normal. The only real change is the fast-approaching
performance deadline. Everything is being taught faster and faster. All the
subjects are being taught as before and nothing new has really happened. The
only new thing is the Jeremy found some Chinese burritos across the street and
everyone bought them. Also, I started on a script for our final performance. It
is about ping-pong diplomacy; however the script is very shot. Only three days
till fp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/11 每 Probably our last teaching day,
though we practiced a lot anyway. In English, we practiced ※I gotta feeling§
and played word games. In Music, we coordinated the recorders and chorus
together, which was pretty good except for the fact that the singers were out
of tune with the recorders. In Computers, we left that to Derek for the
research project. History was a big success, thanks to Richard. To teach
ping-pong diplomacy, we used tables to make a ping-pong table and played
ping-pong the entire class. Everyone loved it. At lunch, we had those burritos
again but they were made by the popsicle lady. This was because students were
getting sick from eating the burritos across the street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/12 每 One more day until the final
performance. I was pretty nervous in the morning since the class wasn＊t doing
so well during practice, but as the day passed my fears was calmed. In English,
the class＊ timing problem was corrected and the dance was almost perfected. For
music, the recorders were complete but the chorus was still out of tune, but my
fellow teachers told me to just leave it alone. For the skit, I＊m not sure
since Richard took charge of that. Later in the day, yozi took the class to the
stage to perform and since the class didn＊t do se well, yozi made them stay
there after school. The class was still having issues with timing, and now with
the movements that are to accompany the singing. In the mean time, I was called
up to vote for the best research project. I didn＊t really understand the
categories and voted wrong; Derek＊s project was only one away from victory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/13 每 Day of Performance, my class arrived
early to practice and by 8:30 the class finally had ※I gotta feeling§ down.
Next was molihua, which the class was also able to successfully perform, plus
the new addition of guzheng. In the actual final performance, I believe our
class performed well, but not exceptionally so. In the molihua performance, the
recorders and the guzheng did well but the singers were still off tune. In the
skit, I don＊t want to think about. For ※I gotta feeling§, the speakers were
louder than the children, though Richard danced very well. I felt Luke＊s class
was the most organized but Michael＊s, Angela＊s, and Colby＊s class had the best
performance. After the performance was heart-warming and crushing farewell with
the students. They were all crying and hugging us, you just didn＊t want to
leave. At night, there was a party where there was a lot of food. Many of us
stayed up very late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>8/14 每 We had another farewell, with our
students and friends. I, Angela, Christine, and Juyou left early for the train
to Beijing. Not many interesting things happened on the bus ride to the station,
though the bus tire did go flat and the bus almost, it felt like, flipped over.
Our first stop was at the airport where some college students, Andy, and Emily
left. We then ate lunch at KFC, which was very good. I got a chicken sandwich
and two pieces of spicy chicken. Christine also said that it was her first KFC;
fml for her. After lunch, we went to the train station where we stored our
luggage away. Then we came out the roam the streets. Seeing a M.C, we went
there to buy some drinks. We stopped at a convenience store where we bought
some candies and saw a really funny sign. In 10 minutes, we returned to the
train station to board the train. Bad news was that I lost my train ticket
while doing something. On the train, we talked about our YBB experience and
looked at pictures. When we arrived at Beijing, I still couldn＊t find my train
ticket, so I had to buy another. I will never forget this experience and more
so the people I have met and become friends with.</span></p>
